Why is gold golden?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/16633/why-is-gold-golden,41k,"Yes, this is a beautiful question.
As you said, in lower rows of the periodic table, there are relativistic effects for the electrons. That is, for core electrons in gold, the electrons are traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light (e.g., ~58% for $\ce{Au}$ $\mathrm{1s}$ electrons). This contracts the Bohr radius of the $\mathrm{1s}$ electrons by ~22%. Source: Wikipedia
This also contracts the size of other orbitals, including the $\mathrm{6s}$.
The absorption you see is a $\mathrm{5d \rightarrow 6s}$ transition. For the silver $\mathrm{4d \rightarrow 5s}$ transition, the absorption is in the UV region, but the contraction gives gold a blue absorption (i.e. less blue is reflected). Our eyes thus see a yellow color reflected.

Why can we smell copper?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/7916/why-can-we-smell-copper,73k,"This is a nice question, as it confronts a very replicable and common experience with a well established yet seemingly contradictory fact. As you expected, the smell of metal has nothing to do with the metal actually getting into your nose, as most metals have far too low of a vapor pressure at ordinary temperatures to allow direct detection. The characteristic smell of metal, in fact, is caused by organic substances!
There has been the focus on the specific case of the smell of iron (free-access article!). There are at least two ways in which iron produces a metallic smell. Firstly, acidic substances are capable of corroding iron and steel, releasing phosphorus and carbon atoms present in the metal or alloy. These can react to form volatile organophosphorus compounds such as methylphosphine ($\ce{H3CPH2}$ which have a garlic/metallic odor at small concentrations. From the article:

The “garlic” metallic odor (see Supporting Information) of the gas product from the acidic dissolution of cast iron is dominated by these organophosphines. We measured an extremely low odor threshold for two key odorants, methylphosphine and dimethylphosphine (6 and 3 ng P/m³, respectively, garlic-metallic odor), which belong therefore to the most potent odorants known. Phosphine ($\ce{PH3}$) is not important for this odor because we found it has a much higher odor detection threshold (>10⁶ ng/m³). A “calcium carbide” (or “burned lime”/“cement”) attribute of the general “garlic” odor is probably caused by unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkynes, alkadienes) that are linked to a high carbon content of iron (Table 1, see Supporting Information).

Also, it turns out that $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ ions (but not $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$) are capable of oxidizing substances present in oils produced by the skin, namely lipid peroxides. A small amount of $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ ions are produced when iron comes into contact with acids in sweat. These then decompose the oils releasing a mixture of ketones and aldehydes with carbon chains between 6 and 10 atoms long. In particular, most of the smell of metal comes from the unsaturated ketone 1-octen-3-one, which has a fungal/metallic odour even in concentrations as low as $1\ \mu g\ m^{-3}$ . In short:

Sweaty skin corrodes iron metal to form reactive $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ ions that are oxidized within seconds to $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$ ions while simultaneously reducing and decomposing existing skin lipid peroxides to odorous carbonyl hydrocarbons that are perceived as a metallic odor.

In the supporting information for the article (also free-access), the authors describe experiments performed with other metals, including copper:

Comparison of iron metal with other metals (copper, brass, zinc, etc.): When solid copper metal or brass (copper-zinc alloy) was contacted with the skin instead of iron, a similar metallic odor and GC-peak pattern of carbonyl hydrocarbons was produced and up to one μmole/dm² of monovalent cuprous ion [$\ce{Cu+}$] was detected as a corrosion product (Supporting Figs. S3 to S6). Zinc, a metal that forms $\ce{Zn^{2+}}$ but no stable $\ce{Zn+}$, was hesitant to form metallic odor, except on very strong rubbing of the metal versus skin (that could produce metastable monovalent $\ce{Zn+}$). The use of common color-tests to demonstrate directly on human palm skin the presence of low-valence ions (ferrous and cuprous) from the corrosion of iron, copper and brass alloys is shown in Supporting Figure S6. Alumina powder rubbed on skin did not produce significant odorants. These results provide additional evidence that it is not metal evaporation, but skin lipid peroxide reduction and decomposition by low valence metal ions that produces the odorants.

The last paragraphs of the article summarize the findings:

In conclusion: 1) The typical “musty” metallic odor of iron metal touching skin (epidermis) is caused by volatile carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones) produced through
the reaction of skin peroxides with ferrous ions ($\ce{Fe^{2+}}$) that are formed in the sweat-mediated corrosion of iron. $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ ion containing metal surfaces, rust, drinking water, blood etc., but also copper and brass, give rise to a similar odor on contact with the skin. The human ability to detect this odor is probably a result of the evolutionarily developed but largely dormant ability to smell blood (“blood scent”).



The “garlic-carbide” metallic odor of phosphorus- and carbon-rich cast iron and steel under attack by acid, is dominated by volatile organophosphines. Corroding cast iron
is an environmental source of C–P compounds that may lead to confusion in the verification and monitoring of the Chemical Weapons Convention (see also ref. [15])


As an aside, this may be why sometimes people recommend getting strong smells off your hands by rubbing them against a metal object. While it probably doesn't work for some metals and for some smelly compounds, it's possible that the metal catalyzes the decomposition of the malodorous substances into less strongly smelling ones.

Is a negative pH level physically possible?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5737/is-a-negative-ph-level-physically-possible,86k,"One publication for you: “Negative pH Does Exist”, K. F. Lim, J. Chem. Educ. 2006, 83, 1465. Quoting the abstract in full:

The misconception that pH lies between 0 and 14 has been perpetuated in popular-science books, textbooks, revision guides, and reference books.

The article text provides some counterexamples:

For example, commercially available concentrated HCl solution (37% by mass) has $\mathrm{pH} \approx -1.1$, while saturated NaOH solution has $\mathrm{pH} \approx 15.0$."
Why is absolute zero unattainable?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/60860/why-is-absolute-zero-unattainable,32k,"There was a story in my days about a physical chemist who was asked to explain some effect, illustrated by a poster on the wall. He did that, after which someone noticed that the poster was hanging upside down, so the effect appeared reversed in sign. Undaunted, the guy immediately explained it the other way around, just as convincingly as he did the first time.
Cooking up explanations on the spot is a respectable sport, but your teacher went a bit too far. What's with that Charles' law? See, it is a gas law; it is about gases. And even then it is but an approximation. To make it exact, you have to make your gas ideal, which can't be done. As you lower the temperature, all gases become less and less ideal. And then they condense, and we're left to deal with liquids and solids, to which the said law never applied, not even as a very poor approximation. Appealing to this law when we are near the absolute zero is about as sensible as ruling out certain reaction mechanism on the grounds that it requires atoms to move faster than allowed by the road speed limit in the state of Hawaii.
The energy argument is even more ridiculous. We don't have to remove all energy, but only the kinetic energy. The $E=mc^2$ part remains there, so the mass is never going anywhere.
All that being said, there is no physical law forbidding the existence of matter at absolute zero. It's not like its existence will cause the world to go down with error 500. It's just that the closer you get to it, the more effort it takes, like with other ideal things (ideal vacuum, ideally pure compound, crystal without defects, etc). If anything, we're doing a pretty decent job at it. Using sophisticated techniques like laser cooling or magnetic evaporative cooling, we've long surpassed the nature's record in coldness."
How do you melt metals with super high melting points?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/16640/how-do-you-melt-metals-with-super-high-melting-points,87k,"Tungsten's melting point of 3422 °C is the highest of all metals and second only to carbon's, for which melting occurs only at high pressure (there's no standard melting point). This is why tungsten is used in rocket nozzles and reactor linings.  There are refractory ceramics and alloys that have higher melting points, notably $\ce{Ta4HfC5}$ with a melting point of 4215 °C, hafnium carbide at 3900 °C and tantalum carbide at 3800 °C.
Carbon cannot be used to hold molten tungsten because they will react to form tungsten carbide.  Sometimes ladles and crucibles used to prepare or transport high melting point materials like tungsten are lined with the various higher melting ceramics or alloys.  More typically tungsten and other refractory materials are fabricated in a non-molten state.  A process known as powder metallurgy is used.  This process uses 4 basic steps:

powder manufacture - a variety of techniques are available to generate small particles of the material being worked
powder blending - routine procedures are used to blend the constituent particles into a uniform mixture
compacting - the blended powder is placed in a mold and subjected to high pressure
sintering - the compacted material is subjected to high temperature and some level of bonding occurs between particles."
What is Bent's rule?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15620/what-is-bents-rule,38k,"That's a good, concise statement of Bent's rule.  Of course we could have just as correctly said that p character tends to concentrate in orbitals directed at electronegative elements. We'll use this latter phrasing when we examine methyl fluoride below. But first, let's expand on the definition a bit so that it is clear to all.
Bent's rule speaks to the hybridization of the central atom ($\ce{A}$) in the molecule $\ce{X-A-Y}$. 
$\ce{A}$ provides hybridized atomic orbitals that form $\ce{A}$'s part of its bond to $\ce{X}$ and to $\ce{Y}$.  Bent's rule says that as we change the electronegativity of $\ce{X}$ and \ or $\ce{Y}$, $\ce{A}$ will tend to rehybridize its orbitals such that more s character will placed in those orbitals directed towards the more electropositive substituent.
Let's examine how Bent's rule might be applied to your example of methyl fluoride.  In the $\ce{C-F}$ bond, the carbon hybrid orbital is directed towards the electronegative fluorine.  Bent's rule suggests that this carbon hybrid orbital will be richer in p character than we might otherwise have suspected.  Instead of the carbon hybrid orbital used in this bond being $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized it will tend to have more p character and therefore move towards $\ce{sp^4}$ hybridization.
Why is this?  s orbitals are lower in energy than p orbitals.  Therefore electrons are more stable (lower energy) when they are in orbitals with more s character.  The two electrons in the $\ce{C-F}$ bond will spend more time around the electronegative fluorine and less time around carbon.  If that's the case (and it is), why ""waste"" precious, low-energy, s orbital character in a carbon hybrid orbital that doesn't have much electron density to stabilize.  Instead, save that s character for use in carbon hybrid orbitals that do have more electron density around carbon (like the $\ce{C-H}$ bonds).  So as a consequence of Bent's rule, we would expect more p character in the carbon hybrid orbital used to form the $\ce{C-F}$ bond, and more s-character in the carbon hybrid orbitals used to form the $\ce{C-H}$ bonds.  
The physically observable result of all this is that we would expect an $\ce{H-C-H}$ angle larger than the tetrahedral angle of 109.5° (reflective of more s character) and an $\ce{H-C-F}$ angle slightly smaller than 109.5°  (reflective of more p character).  In terms of bond lengths, we would expect a shortening of the $\ce{C-H}$ bond (more s character) and a lengthening of the $\ce{C-F}$ bond (more p character)."
Is toothpaste solid or liquid?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/23899/is-toothpaste-solid-or-liquid,68k,"Toothpaste is what is called a non-newtonian fluid, more specifically toothpaste is a Bingham plastic.  This means that the viscosity of the fluid is linearly dependent on the shear stress, but with an offset called the yield stress (see figure below). This yield stress is what makes it hard to say whether it is liquid or solid. The fact that toothpaste is viscous alone is not sufficient to explain this, because water is also viscous, but doesn't behave like a solid (unless frozen, but that's another phenomenon).

What the yield stress does is the following. Below a certain shear threshold the fluid responds as if it were a solid, as you can see happening when you have put toothpaste on your toothbrush, it just sits there without flowing away. A highly viscous but newtonian fluid would flow away (although slowly as pointed out by @ron in his comment to the answer of @freddy).
Now if you put sufficient shear stress on the toothpaste, when you squeeze the tube of paste, it will start flowing and respond as a liquid.
Other examples, as mentioned in the Wikipedia link in my first sentence, are e.g. mayonnaise and mustard. Another example is silly putty."

"Bonding in diatomic C2, a carbon-carbon quadruple bond?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/594/bonding-in-diatomic-c2-a-carbon-carbon-quadruple-bond,42k,"Okay, this is not so much of an answer as it is a summary of my own progress on this topic after giving it some thought. I don't think it's a settled debate in the community yet, so I don't feel so much ashamed about it :)
A few of the things worthy of note are:

The bond energy found by the authors for this fourth bond is $\pu{13.2 kcal/mol}$, i.e. about $\pu{55 kJ/mol}$. This is very weak for a covalent bond. You can compare it to other values here, or to the energies of the first three bonds in triple-bonded carbon, which are respectively $348, 266$, and $\pu{225 kJ/mol}$. This fourth bond is actually even weaker than the strongest of hydrogen bonds ($\ce{F\bond{...}H–F}$, at $\pu{160 kJ/mol}$). Another point of view on this article could thus be: “valence bond necessarily predicts a quadruple bond, and it was now precisely calculated and found to be quite weak.”

The findings of this article are consistent with earlier calculations using other quantum chemistry methods (e.g. the DFT calculations in ref. 48 of the Nature Chemistry paper) which have found a bond order between 3 and 4 for molecular dicarbon.

However, the existence of this quadruple bonds is somewhat at odds with the cohesive energy of gas-phase dicarbon, which according to Wikipedia is $\pu{6.32 eV}$, i.e. $\pu{609 kJ/mol}$. This latter value is much more in line with typical double bonds, reported at an average of $\pu{614 kJ/mol}$. This is still a bit of a misery to me…"

I'd like to throw a tentative explanation for the ortho effect into the ring:

In the molecules in question, an interaction between the protons of the methyl group and the lone pair of the amine nitrogen and the negative charge on the carboxylate, respectively,  can be assumed.
In the first case, the electron density on the N atom is (slightly) reduced and thus the basicity of o-toluidine.
In the latter case, a similar interaction provides additional stabilisation of the carboxylate. As a result, o-toluic acid is more acidic than the isomers."
Why is it wrong to use the concept of hybridization for transition metal complexes?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/76726/why-is-it-wrong-to-use-the-concept-of-hybridization-for-transition-metal-complex,12k,"Tetrahedral complexes
Let's consider, for example, a tetrahedral $\ce{Ni(II)}$ complex ($\mathrm{d^8}$), like $\ce{[NiCl4]^2-}$. According to hybridisation theory, the central nickel ion has $\mathrm{sp^3}$ hybridisation, the four $\mathrm{sp^3}$-type orbitals are filled by electrons from the chloride ligands, and the $\mathrm{3d}$ orbitals are not involved in bonding.

Already there are several problems with this interpretation. The most obvious is that the $\mathrm{3d}$ orbitals are very much involved in (covalent) bonding: a cursory glance at a MO diagram will show that this is the case. If they were not involved in bonding at all, they should remain degenerate, which is obviously untrue; and even if you bring in crystal field theory (CFT) to say that there is an ionic interaction, it is still not sufficient.
If accuracy is desired, the complex can only really be described by a full MO diagram. One might ask why we should believe the MO diagram over the hybridisation picture. The answer is that there is a wealth of experimental evidence, especially electronic spectroscopy ($\mathrm{d-d^*}$ transitions being the most obvious example), and magnetic properties, that is in accordance with the MO picture and not the hybridisation one. It is simply impossible to explain many of these phenomena using this $\mathrm{sp^3}$ model.
Lastly, hybridisation alone cannot explain whether a complex should be tetrahedral ($\ce{[NiCl4]^2-}$) or square planar ($\ce{[Ni(CN)4]^2-}$, or $\ce{[PtCl4]^2-}$). Generally the effect of the ligand, for example, is explained using the spectrochemical series. However, hybridisation cannot account for the position of ligands in the spectrochemical series! To do so you would need to bring in MO theory.

Octahedral complexes
Moving on to $\ce{Ni(II)}$ octahedral complexes, like $\ce{[Ni(H2O)6]^2+}$, the typical explanation is that there is $\mathrm{sp^3d^2}$ hybridisation. But all the $\mathrm{3d}$ orbitals are already populated, so where do the two $\mathrm{d}$ orbitals come from? The $\mathrm{4d}$ set, I suppose.

The points raised above for tetrahedral case above still apply here. However, here we have something even more criminal: the involvement of $\mathrm{4d}$ orbitals in bonding. This is simply not plausible, as these orbitals are energetically inaccessible. On top of that, it is unrealistic to expect that electrons will be donated into the $\mathrm{4d}$ orbitals when there are vacant holes in the $\mathrm{3d}$ orbitals.
For octahedral complexes where there is the possibility for high- and low-spin forms (e.g., $\mathrm{d^5}$ $\ce{Fe^3+}$ complexes), hybridisation theory becomes even more misleading:

Hybridisation theory implies that there is a fundamental difference in the orbitals involved in metal-ligand bonding for the high- and low-spin complexes. However, this is simply not true (again, an MO diagram will illustrate this point). And the notion of $\mathrm{4d}$ orbitals being involved in bonding is no more realistic than it was in the last case, which is to say, utterly unrealistic. In this situation, one also has the added issue that hybridisation theory provides no way of predicting whether a complex is high- or low-spin, as this again depends on the spectrochemical series.

Summary
Hybridisation theory, when applied to transition metals, is both incorrect and inadequate.
It is incorrect in the sense that it uses completely implausible ideas ($\mathrm{3d}$ metals using $\mathrm{4d}$ orbitals in bonding) as a basis for describing the metal complexes. That alone should cast doubt on the entire idea of using hybridisation for the $\mathrm{3d}$ transition metals.
However, it is also inadequate in that it does not explain the rich chemistry of the transition metals and their complexes, be it their geometries, spectra, reactivities, or magnetic properties. This prevents it from being useful even as a predictive model.

What about other chemical species?
You mentioned that hybridisation works well for ""other compounds."" That is really not always the case, though. For simple compounds like water, etc. there are already issues associated with the standard VSEPR/hybridisation theory. Superficially, the $\mathrm{sp^3}$ hybridisation of oxygen is consistent with the observed bent structure, but that's just about all that can be explained. The photoelectron spectrum of water shows very clearly that the two lone pairs on oxygen are inequivalent, and the MO diagram of water backs this up. Apart from that, hybridisation has absolutely no way of explaining the structures of boranes; Wade's rules do a much better job with the delocalised bonding.
And these are just Period 2 elements - when you go into the chemistry of the heavier elements, hybridisation generally becomes less and less useful a concept. For example, hypervalency is a huge problem: $\ce{SF6}$ is claimed to be $\mathrm{sp^3d^2}$ hybridised, but in fact $\mathrm{d}$-orbital involvement in bonding is negligible. On the other hand, non-hypervalent compounds, such as $\ce{H2S}$, are probably best described as unhybridised - what happened to the theory that worked so well for $\ce{H2O}$? It just isn't applicable here, for reasons beyond the scope of this post.
There is probably one scenario in which it is really useful, and that is when describing organic compounds. The reason for this is because tetravalent carbon tends to conform to the simple categories of $\mathrm{sp}^n$ $(n \in \{1, 2, 3\})$; we don't have the same teething issues with $\mathrm{d}$-orbitals that have been discussed above. But there are caveats. For example, it is important to recognise that it is not atoms that are hybridised, but rather orbitals: for example, each carbon in cyclopropane uses $\mathrm{sp^5}$ orbitals for the $\ce{C-C}$ bonds and $\mathrm{sp^2}$ orbitals for the $\ce{C-H}$ bonds.
The bottom line is that every model that we use in chemistry has a range of validity, and we should be careful not to use a model in a context where it is not valid. Hybridisation theory is not valid in the context of transition metal complexes, and should not be used as a means of explaining their structure, bonding, and properties."
Why would breathing pure oxygen be a bad idea?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/61406/why-would-breathing-pure-oxygen-be-a-bad-idea,26k,"The other answers here, describing oxygen toxicity are telling what can go wrong if you have too much oxygen, but they are not describing two important concepts that should appear with their descriptions. Also, there is a basic safety issue with handling pressure tanks of high oxygen fraction.
An important property of breathed oxygen is its partial pressure. At normal conditions at sea level, the partial pressure of oxygen is about 0.21 atm. This is compatible with the widely known estimate that the atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% ""other"". Partial pressures are added to give total pressure; this is Dalton's Law. As long as you don't use toxic gasses, you can replace the nitrogen and ""other"" with other gasses, like Helium, as long as you keep the partial pressure of oxygen near 0.21, and breathe the resulting mixtures without adverse effects.
There are two hazards that can be understood by considering the partial pressure of oxygen. If the partial pressure drops below about 0.16 atm, a normal person experiences hypoxia. This can happen by entering a room where oxygen has been removed. For instance, entering a room which has a constant source of nitrogen constantly displacing the room air, lowering the concentration -- and partial pressure -- of oxygen. Another way is to go to the tops of tall mountains. The total atmospheric pressure is lowered and the partial pressure of oxygen can be as low as 0.07 atm (summit of Mt. Everest) which is why very high altitude climbing requires carrying additional oxygen. Yet a third way is ""horsing around"" with Helium tanks -- repeatedly inhaling helium to produce very high pitched voices deprives the body of oxygen and the partial pressure of dissolved oxygen in the body falls, perhaps leading to loss of consciousness.
Alternatively, if the partial pressure rises above about 1.4 atm, a normal person experiences hyperoxia which can lead to oxygen toxicity (described in the other answers). At 1.6 atm the risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity is very high. So, don't regulate the pressure that high? There's a problem. If you were to make a 10-foot long snorkel and dive to the bottom of a swimming pool to use it, you would fail to inhale. The pressure of air at your mouth would be about 1 atm, because the 10-foot column of air in the snorkel doesn't weigh very much. The pressure of water trying to squeeze the air out of you (like a tube of toothpaste) is about 1.3 atm. Your diaphragm is not strong enough to overcome the squeezing and fill your lungs with air. Divers overcome this problem by using a regulator (specifically, a demand valve), which allows the gas pressure at the outlet to be very near that of the ambient pressure. The principle job of the regulator is to reduce the very high pressure inside the tank to a much lower pressure at the outlet. The demand valve tries to only supply gas when the diver inhales and tries to supply it at very nearly ambient pressure. Notice that at depth the ambient pressure can be much greater than 1 atm, increasing by about 1 atm per 10 m (or 33 feet). If the regulator were to supply normal air at 2 atm pressure, the partial pressure of oxygen would be 0.42 atm. If at 3 atm, 0.63 atm. So as a diver descends, the partial pressure of oxygen automatically increases as a consequence of having to increase the gas pressure to allow the diver to inflate their lungs. Around 65 m (220 ft), the partial pressure of oxygen in an ""air mix"" would be high enough to risk hyperoxia and other dangerous consequences.
Now imagine a gas cylinder containing 100% oxygen. If we breathe from it at the surface, the partial pressure of oxygen is 1 atm -- high, but not dangerous. At a depth of 10 m, the partial pressure of supplied oxygen is 2 atm -- exceeding acceptable exposure limits. This is a general pattern -- raising the oxygen fraction of diving gasses decreases the maximum diving depth.
And you can't lower the partial pressure much because the lower limit, 0.16 atm, isn't that much lower than the 0.21 atm of sea level atmosphere.
One general category of solutions is to change gas mixes at various depths. This is complicated, requires a great deal of planning, and is outside the scope of your question. But it is certainly not as straightforward as just simplifying the gas mixtures or just raising the partial pressure of oxygen.
Additionally, compressed oxygen is a relatively annoying gas to work with. It is not itself flammable, but it makes every nearby organic thing flammable. For instance using grease or oil on or near an oxygen fitting risks spontaneously igniting the grease or oil. Merely having grease on your hand while handling oxygen refilling gear (with a small leak) can burn your hand."
Could a magnet pull oxygen out of the air?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33994/could-a-magnet-pull-oxygen-out-of-the-air,19k,"I'm a physicist, so apologies if the answer below is in a foreign language;  but this was too interesting of a problem to pass up.  I'm going to focus on a particular question:  If we have oxygen and nothing else in a box, how strong does the magnetic field need to be to concentrate the gas in a region?  The TL;DR is that thermal effects are going to make this idea basically impossible.
The force on a magnetic dipole $\vec{m}$ is $\vec{F} = \vec{\nabla}(\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B})$, where $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field.  Let us assume that the dipole moment of the oxygen molecule is proportional to the magnetic field at that point:  $\vec{m} = \alpha \vec{B}$, where $\alpha$ is what we might call the ""molecular magnetic susceptibility.""  Then we have $\vec{F} = \vec{\nabla}(\alpha \vec{B} \cdot \vec{B})$.  But potential energy is given by $\vec{F} = - \vec{\nabla} U$;  which implies that an oxygen molecule moving in a magnetic field acts as though it has a potential energy $U(\vec{r}) = - \alpha B^2$.
Now, if we're talking about a sample of gas at a temperature $T$, then the density of the oxygen molecules in equilibrium will be proportional to the Boltzmann factor:
$$
\rho(\vec{r}) \propto \mathrm e^{-U(\vec{r})/kT} = \mathrm e^{-\alpha B^2/kT} 
$$
In the limit where $kT \gg \alpha B^2$, this exponent will be close to zero, and the density will not vary significantly from point to point in the sample.  To get a significant difference in the density of oxygen from point to point, we have to have $\alpha B^2 \gtrsim kT$;  in other words, the magnetic potential energy must comparable to (or greater than) the thermal energy of the molecules, or otherwise random thermal motions will cause the oxygen to diffuse out of the region of higher magnetic field.
So how high does this have to be?  The $\alpha$ we have defined above is approximately related to the molar magnetic susceptibility by $\chi_\text{mol} \approx \mu_0 N_\mathrm A \alpha$; and so we have1
$$
\chi_\text{mol} B^2 \gtrsim \mu_0 RT
$$
and so we must have
$$

If you believe Wikipedia, the molar susceptibility of oxygen gas is $4.3 \times 10^{-8}\ \text{m}^3/\text{mol}$;  and plugging in the numbers, we get a requirement for a magnetic field of
$$
B \gtrsim \pu{258 T}.
$$
This is over five times stronger than the strongest continuous magnetic fields ever produced, and 25–100 times stronger than most MRI machines.  Even at $\pu{91 Kelvin}$ (just above the boiling point of oxygen), you would need a magnetic field of almost $\pu{150 T}$; still well out of range.

1 I'm making an assumption here that the gas is sufficiently diffuse that we can ignore the magnetic interactions between the molecules.  A better approximation could be found by using a magnetic analog of the Clausius-Mossotti relation;  and if the gas gets sufficiently dense, then all bets are off."

Why do elements in columns 6 and 11 assume 'abnormal' electron configurations?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/151/why-do-elements-in-columns-6-and-11-assume-abnormal-electron-configurations,34k,"As I understand this, there are basically two effects at work here.
When you populate an $\mathrm{s}$-orbital, you add a significant amount of electron density close to the nucleus. This screens the attractive charge of the nucleus from the $\mathrm{d}$-orbitals, making them higher in energy (and more radially diffuse). The difference in energy between putting all the electrons in $\mathrm{d}$-orbitals and putting one in an $\mathrm{s}$-orbital increases as you fill the $\mathrm{d}$-orbitals.
Additionally, pairing electrons in one orbital (so, adding the second $\mathrm{s}$ electron) carries a significant energy cost in terms of Coulombic repulsion because you're adding an electron essentially in exactly the same space as there's already an electron.
I'm assuming that the effect isn't strong enough to avert fluorine having a $\mathrm{2s^2}$ occupation, and if you look at gadolinium, the effect there isn't strong enough to stop the $\mathrm{s}$ from filling (large nuclear charge and orbital extent at the nucleus is a good combination energy-wise), it does manage to make it more favourable to add the electron into the $\mathrm{5d}$ instead of the $\mathrm{4f}$ orbitals.
Also, if you take a look at tungsten vs gold, there the effect isn't strong enough for tungsten to avoid a $\mathrm{6s^2}$ occupation, but is for gold - more $\mathrm{d}$ electrons making the screening effect overcome the strong nuclear charge and enhanced nuclear penetration of an $\mathrm{s}$-orbital."
Why does F replace the axial bond in PCl5?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/18427/why-does-f-replace-the-axial-bond-in-pcl5,12k,"Recently, there has been a lot of discussion of Bent's rule (see for example ""What is Bent's rule?"") here in SE Chem. Simply stated, the rule suggests that $\mathrm{p}$-character tends to concentrate in orbitals directed at electronegative elements.

Why does $\ce{F}$ replace an axial bond in $\ce{PCl5}$?

In order to answer this question, we need to start by understanding the bonding in $\ce{PCl5}$ and its fluorinated isomers. In introductory courses and texts, it is usually stated that $\ce{AX5}$ type molecules adopt a trigonal bipyramid geometry and are $\mathrm{sp^{3}d}$ hybridized. As the comments by Martin and permeakra point out, and as is learned in more advanced classes, this hybridization scheme is likely incorrect. There are several reasons that argue against $\mathrm{sp^{3}d}$ hybridization including: 1) the fact that $\mathrm{d}$ orbitals are relatively high in energy compared to $\mathrm{s}$ and $\mathrm{p}$ orbitals and therefore it is energetically quite costly to involve them in bonding; and 2) $\mathrm{d}$ orbitals in non-metals are very diffuse leading to poor overlap with other orbitals and any resulting bonds would be very weak.
A reasonable hybridization alternative involves what is termed hypercoordinated bonding; where 3 center, 4 electron bonds are involved. Applying this concept to $\ce{PCl5}$ we would say that the central phosphorus atom is $\mathrm{sp^2}$ hybridized.  Thus, there would be 3 $\mathrm{sp^2}$ orbitals (these will be used to create the equatorial bonds) and a $\mathrm{p}$ orbital (this will be used to create our axial bonds) emanating from the central phosphorus atom.

The $\mathrm{p}$ orbital contains 2 electrons and will form bonds to 2 ligands (chlorine or fluorine in the case at hand). For simplicity, let's say that these ligands also use $\mathrm{p}$ orbitals for bonding (but it could be any type of orbital, $\mathrm{sp^3}$ or whatever is appropriate) and each of these orbitals contains one electron for bonding. This is our 3-center-4-electron bond and its MO diagram is pictured below. Notice how the four electrons are distributed - there are two electrons in the HOMO which is a non-bonding M.O., so the bond order in this bond is reduced.

This reduced bond order in the bond using the phosphorus $\mathrm{p}$ orbital explains why the axial bonds in $\ce{AX5}$ type molecules are longer than the equatorial bonds.

Now that we understand the bonding in $\ce{PCl5}$ we can consider the case of $\ce{PCl4F}$ and how Bent's rule applies to the situation.  First, note that fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine.  As stated above, Bent's rule suggests that more electronegative ligands prefer to form bonds with orbitals that are high in $\mathrm{p}$-character. Why is this? $\mathrm{s}$-Orbitals are lower in energy than $\mathrm{p}$-orbitals. Therefore electrons are more stable (lower energy) when they are in orbitals with more $\mathrm{s}$-character. The two electrons in the $\ce{P-F}$ bond will spend more time around the electronegative fluorine and less time around phosphorus. If that's the case (and it is), why ""waste"" precious, low-energy, $\mathrm{s}$-orbital character in an orbital that doesn't have much electron density to stabilize. Instead, save that $\mathrm{p}$-character for use in phosphorus hybrid orbitals that do have more electron density around phosphorus (like the $\ce{P-Cl}$ bonds). So, as a consequence of Bent's rule, we would expect phosphorus to use the orbital with lowest $\mathrm{s}$-character, the axial $\mathrm{p}$-orbital, to form the $\ce{P-F}$ bond; and the orbitals with more $\mathrm{s}$-character, the equatorial $\mathrm{sp^2}$ orbitals, to form $\ce{P-Cl}$ bonds."
How does Walter White make pure crystal meth using a non-stereospecific reaction?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/7489/how-does-walter-white-make-pure-crystal-meth-using-a-non-stereospecific-reaction,28k,"Intriguing question. 
First, the best yield would be achieved by selectively producing one enantiomer instead of the other. In this case, White wants D-methamphetamine (powerful psychoactive drug), not L-methamphetamine (Vicks Vapor Inhaler). Reaction processes designed to do this are known as ""asymmetric synthesis"" reactions, because they favor production of one enantiomer over the other.
The pseudoephedrine method for methamphetamine employs one of the more common methods of asymmetric synthesis, called ""chiral pool resolution"". As you state, starting with an enantiomerically-pure sample of a chiral reagent (pseudoephedrine) as the starting point allows you to preserve the chirality of the finished product, provided the chiral point is not part of any ""leaving group"" during the reaction. However, again as you show, phenylacetone is achiral, and so the P2P process cannot take advantage of this method.
There are other methods of asymmetric synthesis, however none of them seem applicable to the chemistry shown or described on TV either; none of the reagents or catalysts mentioned would work as chiral catalysts, nor are they bio- or organocatalysts. Metal complexes with chiral ligands can be used to selectively catalyze production of one enantiomer, however the aluminum-mercury amalgam is again achiral. I don't remember any mention of using organocatalysis or biocatalysis, but these are possible.
The remaining route, then, is chiral resolution; let the reaction produce the 50-50 split, then separate the two enantiomers by some means of reactionary and/or physical chemistry. This seems to be the way it works in the real world. The advantage is that most of the methods are pretty cheap and easy; the disadvantage is that your maximum possible yield is 50% (unless you can then run a racemization reaction on the undesireable half to ""reshuffle"" the chirality of that half; then your yield increases by 50% of the last increase each time you run this step on the undesirable product).
In the case of methamphetamine, this resolution is among the easiest, because methamphetamine forms a ""racemic conglomerate"" when crystallized. This means, for the non-chemists, that each enantiomer molecule prefers to crystallize with others of the same chiral species, so as the solution cools and the solvent is evaporated off, the D-methamphetamine will form one set of homogeneous crystals and the L-methamphetamine will form another set. This means that all White has to do is slow the evaporation of solvent and subsequent cooling of the pan, letting the largest possible crystals form. Then, the only remaining trick is identifying which crystals have which enantiomer (and as these crystals are translucent and ""optically active"", observing the polarization pattern of light shone through the crystals will identify which are which)."

Why doesn't H₄O²⁺ exist?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/112087/why-doesnt-h%e2%82%84o%c2%b2%e2%81%ba-exist,32k,"I myself was always confused why $\ce{H3O^+}$ is so well-known and yet almost nobody talks of $\ce{H4O^2+}$. I mean, $\ce{H3O^+}$ still has a lone pair, right? Why can't another proton just latch onto that? Adding to the confusion, $\ce{H4O^2+}$ is very similar to $\ce{NH4+}$, which again is extremely well-known. Even further, the methanium cation $\ce{CH5+}$ exists (admittedly not something you'll find on a shelf), and that doesn't even have an available lone pair!
It is very useful to rephrase the question ""why is $\ce{H4O^2+}$ so rare?"" into ""why won't $\ce{H3O^+}$ accept another proton?"". Now we can think of this in terms of an acid-base reaction:
$$\ce{H3O^+ + H+ -> H4O^2+}$$
Yes, that's right. In this reaction $\ce{H3O^+}$ is the base, and $\ce{H^+}$ is the acid. Because solvents can strongly influence the acidity of basicity of dissolved compounds, and because inclusion of solvent makes calculations tremendously more complicated, we will restrict ourselves to the gas phase (hence $\ce{(g)}$ next to all the formulas). This means we will be talking about proton affinities.
Before we get to business, though, let's start with something more familiar:
$$\ce{H2O(g) + H+(g) -> H3O^+(g)}$$
Because this is in the gas phase, we can visualise the process very simply. We start with a lone water molecule in a perfect vacuum. Then, from a very large distance away, a lone proton begins its approach. We can calculate the potential energy of the whole system as a function of the distance between the oxygen atom and the distant proton. We get a graph that looks something like this:

For convenience, we can set the potential energy of the system at 0 when the distance is infinite. At very large distances, the lone proton only very slightly tugs the electrons of the $\ce{H2O}$ molecule, but they attract and the system is slightly stabilised. The attraction gets stronger as the lone proton approaches. However, there is also a repulsive interaction, between the lone proton and the nuclei of the other atoms in the $\ce{H2O}$ molecule. At large distances, the attraction is stronger than the repulsion, but this flips around if the distance is too short. The happy medium is where the extra proton is close enough to dive into the molecule's electron cloud, but not close enough to experience severe repulsions with the other nuclei.
In short, a lone proton from infinity is attracted to a water molecule, and the potential energy decreases up to a critical value, the bond length. The amount of energy lost is the proton affinity: in this scenario, a mole of water molecules reacting with a mole of protons would release approximately $\mathrm{697\ kJ\ mol^{-1}}$ (values from this table). This reaction is highly exothermic
Alright, now for the next step:
$$\ce{H3O^+(g) + H+(g) -> H4O^2+(g)}$$
This should be similar, right? Actually, no. There is a very important difference between this reaction and the previous one; the reagents now both have a net positive charge. This means there is now a strong additional repulsive force between the two. In fact, the graph above changes completely. Starting from zero potential at infinity, instead of a slow decrease in potential energy, the lone proton has to climb uphill, fighting a net electrostatic repulsion. However, even more interestingly, if the proton does manage to get close enough, the electron cloud can abruptly envelop the additional proton and create a net attraction. The resulting graph now looks more like this:

Very interestingly, the bottom of the ""pocket"" on the left of the graph (the potential well) can have a higher potential energy than if the lone proton was infinitely far away. This means the reaction is endothermic, but with enough effort, an extra proton can be pushed into the molecule, and it gets trapped in the pocket. Indeed, according to Olah et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986,  108 (5), pp 1032-1035, the formation of $\ce{H4O^2+}$ in the gas phase was calculated to be endothermic by $\mathrm{248\ kJ\ mol^{-1}}$ (that is, the proton affinity of $\ce{H3O^+}$ is $\mathrm{-248\ kJ\ mol^{-1}}$), but once formed, it has a barrier towards decomposition (the activation energy towards release of a proton) of $\mathrm{184\ kJ\ mol^{-1}}$ (the potential well has a maximum depth of $\mathrm{184\ kJ\ mol^{-1}}$).
Due to the fact that $\ce{H4O^2+}$ was calculated to form a potential well, it can in principle exist. However, since it is the product of a highly endothermic reaction, unsurprisingly it is very hard to find. The reality in solution phase is more complicated, but its existence has been physically verified (if indirectly).
But why stop here? What about $\ce{H5O^3+}$?
$$\ce{H4O^2+(g) + H+(g) -> H5O^3+(g)}$$
I've run a rough calculation myself using computational chemistry software, and here it seems we really do reach a wall. It appears that $\ce{H5O^3+}$ is an unbound system, which is to say that its potential energy curve has no pocket like the ones above. $\ce{H5O^3+}$ could only ever be made transiently, and it would immediately spit out at least one proton. The reason here really is the massive amount of electrical repulsion, combined with the fact that the electron cloud can't reach out to the distance necessary to accommodate another atom.
You can make your own potential energy graphs here. Note how depending on the combination of parameters, the potential well can lie at negative potential energies (an exothermic reaction) or positive potential energies (an endothermic reaction). Alternatively, the pocket may not exist at all - these are the unbound systems. 
EDIT: I've done some calculations of proton affinities/stabilities on several other simple molecules, for comparison. I do not claim the results to be quantitatively correct.

Notes:

Even without a lone pair, methane ($\ce{CH4}$) protonates very exothermically in the gas phase. This is a testament to the enormous reactivity of a bare proton, and the huge difference it makes to not have push a proton into an already positively-charged ion.
For most of the seemingly hypercoordinate species in these tables (more than four bonds), the excess hydrogen atoms ""pair up"" such that it can be viewed as a $\ce{H2}$ molecule binding sideways to the central atom. See the methanium link at the start.

Notes:

Even though the first protonation is easier relative to $\ce{CH4}$, the second one is harder. This is likely because increasing the electronegativity of the central atom makes the electron cloud ""stiffer"", and less accommodating to all those extra protons.

$\ce{H3O+}$ is easier to protonate than $\ce{NH4+}$, even though oxygen is more electronegative. This is because the $\ce{H4O^2+}$ nicely accommodates all protons, while one of the protons in  $\ce{NH5^2+}$ has to fight for its space.

Notes:

The lower electronegativity and larger size of $\ce{S}$ means its electrons can reach out further and accommodate protons at a larger distance, while reducing repulsions between the nuclei. Thus, in the gas phase, $\ce{H2S}$ is a stronger base than $\ce{H2O}$. The situation is inverted in aqueous solution due to uniquely strong intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding) which are much more important for $\ce{H2O}$.
$\ce{H3S+}$ also has an endothermic proton affinity, but it is lower than for $\ce{H3O+}$, and therefore $\ce{H4S^2+}$ is easier to make. Accordingly, $\ce{H4S^2+}$ has been detected in milder (though still superacidic!) conditions than $\ce{H4O^2+}$.
The larger size and lower electronegativity of $\ce{S}$ once again are shown to be important; the hypercoodinate $\ce{H5S^3+}$ appears to exist, while the oxygen analogue doesn't."
Why do compounds like SF6 and SF4 exist but SH6 and SH4 don't?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/4760/why-do-compounds-like-sf6-and-sf4-exist-but-sh6-and-sh4-dont,42k,"TL;DR Fluorine is electronegative and can support the extra negative charge that is dispersed on the six X atoms in $\ce{SX6}$, whereas hydrogen cannot.

First, let's debunk a commonly taught myth, which is that the bonding in $\ce{SF6}$ involves promotion of electrons to the 3d orbitals with a resulting $\mathrm{sp^3d^2}$ hybridisation. This is not true. Here's a recent and arguably more understandable reference: J. Chem. Educ. 2020, 97 (10), 3638–3646 which explains this. Quoting:

The natural ionicity, $i_\ce{SF}$, of each $\ce{S-F}$ bond [in $\ce{SF6}$] is 0.86, indicating a rather ionic σ bond. Each fluorine has an average charge of $−0.45$, resulting in a sulfur center of charge $+2.69$. [...] In summary, the electronic structure of this system is best described as a sulfur center with a charge somewhere between $2+$ and $3+$; the corresponding negative charge is distributed among the equivalent fluorine atoms. Shown in Figure 12 is the orbital occupation of the sulfur center, $\ce{3s^1 3p^{2.1} 3d^{0.19} 5p^{0.03} 4f^{0.01}}$. The minimal occupation of d-type orbitals eliminates the possibility of $\mathrm{sp^3d^2}$ hybridization.

If not via d-orbital bonding, how does one then describe the structure of $\ce{SF6}$? I'll present an LCAO-MO answer. Here's a ""simple"" MO diagram (I won't go through the details of how to construct it). It's actually fairly similar to that of an octahedral transition metal complex, except that here the 3s and 3p orbitals on sulfur are below the 3d orbitals.

Just for the sake of counting electrons, I treated the compound as being ""fully ionic"", i.e. $\ce{S^6+} + 6\ce{F-}$. So sulfur started off with 0 valence electrons, and each fluorine started off with 2 electrons in its σ orbitals. I've also neglected the π contribution to bonding, so the fluorine lone pairs don't appear in the diagram.
You'll see that, for a total of six $\ce{S-F}$ bonds, we only have four pairs of electrons in bonding MOs. The other two pairs of electrons reside in the $\mathrm{e_g}$ MOs, which are nonbonding and localised on fluorine. If we want to assign a formal charge to sulfur based on this diagram, it would be +2, because there are only actually four bonds. We could perhaps use Lewis diagrams to represent it this way:

The ""hypervalent"" resonance form contributes rather little and does not rely on invoking d-orbital participation; see Martin's comment on my answer below for greater detail about the resonance contributions. I am guessing that its existence can be mostly attributed to negative hyperconjugation, although I'm not 100% sure on this. The trans and cis resonance forms are not equal, so their contribution is not the same, but the contribution from each individual trans resonance form has to be the same by symmetry. Overall, the six fluorines in $\ce{SF6}$ have to be equivalent by the octahedral symmetry of the molecule. You could run a $\ce{^19F}$ NMR of the compound and it should only give you one peak.
(An alternative way of looking at it is that two of the $\ce{S-F}$ bonds are ""true"" 2c2e bonds, and that the other four $\ce{S-F}$ ""bonds"" are in fact just a couple of 3c4e bonds, but I won't go into that. For more information on multi-centre bonds, this article is a nice introduction: J. Chem. Educ. 1998, 75, 910; see also refs. 12 and 13 in that article.)
Right from the outset, we can see why $\ce{SH6}$ is not favoured as much. If we use the same framework to describe the bonding in $\ce{SH6}$, then those ""correct"" resonance forms that we drew would involve $\ce{H-}$. I'll leave it to the reader to figure out whether $\ce{F-}$ or $\ce{H-}$ is more stable.
Alternatively, if you want to stick to the MO description, the idea is that in $\ce{SH6}$, the relatively high energy of H1s compared to F2p will lead to the nonbonding $\mathrm{e_g}$ orbitals being relatively higher in energy. All things being equal, it's less favourable for a higher-energy orbital to be occupied, and $\ce{SH6}$ would therefore be very prone to losing these electrons, i.e. being oxidised.
In fact, if we do remove those four electrons from the $\mathrm{e_g}$ orbitals, then it's possible that these six-coordinate hydrides could form. But obviously we might not want to have a $\ce{SH6^4+}$ molecule on the loose. It'll probably lose all of its protons in a hurry to get back to being $\ce{H2S + 4H+}$. Is there anything better? Well, there's the species $\ce{CH6^2+}$, which is methane protonated twice. It's valence isoelectronic with $\ce{SH6^4+}$, and if you want to read about it, here's an article: J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 5258. While it's hardly the most stable molecule on the planet, it's certainly more plausible than $\ce{SH6}$.
Now, just to come back to where we started from: d-orbital participation. Yes, there is an $\mathrm{e_g}$ set of d orbitals that can overlap with the apparently ""nonbonding"" $\mathrm{e_g}$ linear combination of F2p orbitals, thereby stabilising it. It is true that some degree of this does happen. The issue is how much. Considering the fairly large energy gap between the $\mathrm{e_g}$ orbitals, this interaction is bound to be fairly small, and is nowhere near enough to justify a $\mathrm{sp^3d^2}$ description of it; Martin's comments contain more details."
How can one explain niobium’s weird electronic configuration?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/2469/how-can-one-explain-niobium-s-weird-electronic-configuration,59k,"There is an explanation to this that can be generalized, which dips a little into quantum chemistry, which is known as the idea of pairing energy. I'm sure you can look up the specifics, but basically in comparing the possible configurations of $\ce{Nb}$, we see the choice of either pairing electrons at a lower energy, or of separating them at higher energy, as seen below:
d:   ↿ ↿ ↿ _ _        ↿ ↿ ↿ ↿ _        ↿ ↿ ↿ ↿ ↿     ^
                 OR               OR               | 
s:   ⥮               ↿                _            Energy gap (E)

The top row is for the d-orbitals, which are higher in energy, and the bottom row is for the s-orbital, which is lower in energy. There is a quantifiable energy gap between the two as denoted on the side (unique for every element). As you may know, electrons like to get in the configuration that is lowest in energy. At first glance, that might suggest putting as many electrons in the s-orbital (lower energy) as possible, and then filling the rest in the d-orbital. This is known as the Aufbau principle and is widely taught in chemistry classes. It's not wrong, and works most of the time, but the story doesn't end there. There is a cost to pairing the electrons in the lower orbital, two costs actually, which I will define now:
Repulsion energy: Pretty simple, the idea that e- repel, and having two of them in the same orbital will cost some energy. Normally counted as 1 C for every pair of electrons.
Exchange energy: This is a little tricky, and probably the main reason this isn't taught until later in your chemistry education. Basically (due to quantum chemistry which I won't bore you with), there is a beneficial energy associated with having pairs of like energy, like spin electrons. Basically, for every pair of electrons at the same energy level (or same orbital shell in this case) and same spin (so, if you had 2 e- in the same orbital, no dice, since they have to be opposite spin), you accrue 1 K exchange energy, which is a stabilizing energy. (This is very simplified, but really ""stabilizing energy"" is nothing more than negative energy. I hope your thermodynamics is in good shape!) The thing with exchange (or K) energy is that you get one for every pair, so in the case:
↿ ↿ ↿

from say a p-subshell, you would get 3 K, for each pair, while from this example:
⥮ ↿ ↿ ↿ ↿

from a $\ce{d^6}$, you would get 10 K (for each unique pair, and none for the opposite spin e-)
This K is quantifiable as well (and like the repulsion energy is unique for each atom).
Thus, the combination of these two energies when compared to the band gap determines the state of the electron configuration. Using the example we started with:
d:   ↿ ↿ ↿ _ _         ↿ ↿ ↿ ↿ _         ↿ ↿ ↿ ↿ ↿    ^
s:   ⥮           OR   ↿           OR   _            | 
PE:  3K + 1C          6K + 0C          10K + 0C     Energy gap (E)

You can see from the example that shoving 1 e- up from the s to the d-subshell results in a loss of 1C (losing positive or ""destabilizing"" repulsive energy) and gaining 3K (gaining negative or ""stabilizing"" exchange energy). Therefore, if the sum of these two is greater than the energy gap (i.e. 3K - 1C > E) then the electron will indeed be found in the d shell in $\ce{Nb}$'s ground state. Which is indeed the case for $\ce{Nb}$.
Next, lets look at perhaps exciting the second s e- up to the d-subshell. We gain 4 additional K but don't lose any C, and we must again overcome the energy gap for this electron to be found in the d-subshell.
It turns out that for $\ce{Nb}$: 4K + 0C < E  (remember that C is considered a negative value, which we're not losing any of), so $\ce{Nb}$ is ultimately found in the $\ce{5s^1 4d^4}$ configuration."
Why is FORTRAN so commonly used in computational chemistry?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/24691/why-is-fortran-so-commonly-used-in-computational-chemistry,13k,"I don't think that's really true anymore.
Some Fortran use is historical (i.e., early codes were developed in FORTRAN because that was the best programming language for number crunching in the 70s and 80s). Heck, the name stands for ""formula translation.""
Some Fortran use is because of performance. The language was designed to be:

especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.

Many times, I find chemistry coders sticking to Fortran because they know it and have existing highly optimized numeric code-bases.
I think the performance side isn't necessarily true anymore when using modern, highly optimizing C and C++ compilers.
I write a lot of code in C and C++ for performance and glue a lot of things with Python. I know some quantum programs are written exclusively or primarily in C++. Here are a few open source examples:

Psi4 - Written in C++ and Python
MPQC - Written in C++
LibInt - Written in C++ for efficient quantum integrals.
LibXC - Written in C with Fortran ""bindings"" for DFT exchange-correlation functionals

This is my opinion, but my recommendation for faster performance in chemistry would be Python with some C or C++ mixed in.
I find I'm more efficient coding in Python, partly because of the language, partly because of the many packages, partly since I don't have to compile, and that's all important.
Also, you can run Python scripts and functions in parallel, on the GPU, and even compile them, e.g. with Numba. As I said, if I think performance is crucial, I'll write pieces in C or usually C++ and link to Python as needed."
Are diamonds really forever?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34193/are-diamonds-really-forever,18k,"how long would it take for this super-material to convert to the stuff
  I scribble with?

No, despite the fact that James Bond said ""Diamonds are Forever"", that is not exactly the case. Although Bond's statement is a fair approximation of reality it is not a scientifically accurate description of reality.
As we will soon see, even though diamond is slightly less stable than graphite (by ~ 2.5 kJ/mol), it is kinetically protected by a large activation energy.
Here is a comparative representation of the structures of diamond and graphite.

(image source: Satyanarayana T, Rai R. Nanotechnology: The future. J Interdiscip Dentistry 2011;1:93-100)

(image source)
Note that diamond is composed of cyclohexane rings and each carbon is bonded to 2 more carbons external to the cyclohexane ring. On the other hand, graphite is comprised of benzene rings and each carbon is bonded to only 1 carbon external to the benzene ring. That means we need to break 6 sigma bonds in diamond and make about 2 pi bonds (remember it's an extended array of rings, don't double count) in graphite per 6-membered ring in order to convert diamond to graphite.
A typical aliphatic C–C bond strength is ~340 kJ/mol and a typical pi bond strength is ~260 kJ/mol.  So to break 6 sigma bonds and make 2 pi bonds would require ~((6*340)-(2*260)) ~ 1500 kJ/mol. If the transition state were exactly midway between diamond and carbon (with roughly equal bond breaking and bond making), then we might approximate the activation energy as being half that value or ~750 kJ/mol.  Since graphite is a bit more stable than diamond, we can refine our model and realize that the transition state will occur a bit before the mid-point. So our refined model would suggest an activation energy something less than 750 kJ/mol. Had we attempted to incorporate the effect of aromaticity in graphite our estimate would be even lower.  In any case, this is an extremely large activation energy, so, as we anticipated the reaction would be very slow.
An estimate (see p. 171) of the activation energy puts the reverse reaction (graphite to diamond; but since, as noted above, the energy difference between the two is very small the activation energy for the forward reaction is almost the same) at 367 kJ/mol. So at least our rough approximation was in the right ballpark, off by about a factor of 2. However, it appears that the transition state is even further from the midpoint (closer to starting material) than we might have guessed.
This activation energy tells us that at 25 °C, it would take well over a billion years to convert one cubic centimeter of diamond to graphite.
Note 04/17/20: As mentioned in a comment, the original ""estimate"" link became  defunct and was replaced today with a new estimate link.  However the original article and estimate can can still be seen on the Wayback Machine and it estimates the activation energy to be 538.45 kJ/mol, reasonably close to our estimate."

The last element's atomic number,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/8073/the-last-elements-atomic-number,12k,"Nobody really knows. Using the naive Bohr model of the atom, we run into trouble around $Z=137$ as the innermost electrons would have to be moving above the speed of light. This result is because the Bohr model doesn't take into account relativity. Solving the Dirac equation, which comes from relativistic quantum mechanics, and taking into account that the nucleus is not a point particle, then there seems to be no real issue with arbitrarily high atomic numbers, although unusual effects start happening above $Z \approx 173$. These results may be overturned by an even deeper analysis with current quantum electrodynamics theory, or a new theory altogether.
As far as we can tell, however, we will never get anywhere close to such atomic numbers. Very heavy elements are extremely unstable with respect to radioactive decay into lighter elements. Our current method of producing superheavy elements is based on accelerating a certain isotope of an relatively light element and hitting a target made of an isotope of a much heavier element. This process is extremely inefficient, and it takes many months to produce significant amounts of material. For the heaviest elements, it takes years to detect even a handful of atoms. The very short lifetime of the heaviest targets and the very low collision efficiency between projectile and target mean that it will be extremely difficult to go much further than the current 118 elements. It is possible that we may find somewhat more stable superheavy isotopes in the islands of stability around $Z=114$ and $Z=126$, but the predicted most stable isotopes (which even then are not expect to last more than a few minutes) have such a huge amount of neutrons in their nuclei that we have no idea how to produce them; we may be condemned to merely skirt the shores of the islands of stability, while never climbing them.
EDIT: Note that the best calculation presented above is based on quantum electrodynamics alone, i.e. only electromagnetic forces are taken into account. Obviously, to predict how nuclei will behave (and therefore how many protons you can stuff into a nucleus before it's impossible to go any further), one needs detailed knowledge of the strong and weak nuclear forces. Unfortunately, the mathematical description of nuclear forces is still an incredibly tough problem in physics today, so no one can hope to provide a rigorous answer from that angle. 
There must be some limit, as the residual nuclear forces are very short-ranged. At some point there will be so many protons and neutrons in the nucleus (and the resulting nucleus will have become so large) that the diametrically opposite parts of the nucleus won't be able to ""detect"" each other, as they are too far away. Each additional proton or neutron produces a weaker stabilization via the strong nuclear force. Meanwhile, the electrical repulsion between protons has infinite range, so every additional proton will contribute repulsively just the same. This is why heavier elements need higher and higher neutron-to-proton ratios to remain stable.
Thus, at some atomic number, possibly not much higher than our current record of $Z=118$, the electrical repulsion of the protons will always win against the strong nuclear attractions of protons and neutrons, no matter the configuration of the nucleus. Hence, all sufficiently heavy atomic nuclei will suffer spontaneously fission almost immediately after coming into existence, or all the valid reaction pathways to reach an element will require events which are so fantastically unlikely that if even all the nucleons in the entire observable Universe were being collided with each other since the Big Bang in an attempt to synthesize the heaviest element possible, we would statistically expect some sufficiently heavy atom to not have been produced even once."
How can antibonding orbitals be more antibonding than bonding orbitals are bonding?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/4517/how-can-antibonding-orbitals-be-more-antibonding-than-bonding-orbitals-are-bondi,10k,"Mathematical Explanation
When examining the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) for the $\ce{H2+}$ molecular ion, we get two different energy levels, $E_+$ and $E_-$ depending on the coefficients of the atomic orbitals. The energies of the two different MO's are:
$$\begin{align}
E_+ &= E_\text{1s} + \frac{j_0}{R} - \frac{j' + k'}{1+S} \\
E_- &= E_\text{1s} + \frac{j_0}{R} - \frac{j' - k'}{1-S}
\end{align} $$
Note that $j_0 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$, $R$ is the internuclear distance, $S=\int \chi_\text{A}^* \chi_\text{B}\,\text{d}V$ the overlap integral, $j'$ is a coulombic contribution to the energy and $k'$ is a contribution to the resonance integral, and it does not have a classical analogue. $j'$ and $k'$ are both positive and $j' \gt k'$. You'll note that $j'-k' > 0$.
This is why the energy levels of $E_+$ and $E_-$ are not symmetrical with respect to the energy level of $E_\text{1s}$.
Intuitive Explanation
The intuitive explanation goes along the following line: Imagine two hydrogen nuclei that slowly get closer to each other, and at some point start mixing their orbitals. Now, one very important interaction is the coulomb force between those two nuclei, which gets larger the closer the nuclei come together. As a consequence of this, the energies of the molecular orbitals get shifted upwards, which is what creates the asymmetric image that we have for these energy levels.
Basically, you have two positively charged nuclei getting closer to each other. Now you have two options:

Stick some electrons between them.
Don't stick some electrons between them.

If you follow through with option 1, you'll diminish the coulomb forces between the two nuclei somewhat in favor of electron-nucleus attraction. If you go with method 2 (remember that the $\sigma^*_\text{1s}$ MO has a node between the two nuclei), the nuclei feel each other's repulsive forces more strongly.

What is the reason for the exceptional stability of the cyclopropylmethyl carbocation?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/19090/what-is-the-reason-for-the-exceptional-stability-of-the-cyclopropylmethyl-carboc,27k,"It is commonly said, that a cyclopropane fragment behaves somewhat like a double bond. It can conjugate, and pass mesomeric effect similar to a double bond, but the donor orbital is $\sigma_{\ce{C-C}}$ instead of $\pi_{\ce{C=C}}$. Cyclopropane can be considered as a complex of a carbene and an alkene, where the carbene $\mathrm{p}$ orbital interacts with the $\pi^*_{\ce{C=C}}$ orbital while the carbene $\mathrm{sp^2}$ orbital interacts with the $\pi_{\ce{C=C}}$ orbital, so this 'virtual' double bond behaves somewhat like a normal double bond.
On the other hand, the structure of the cyclopropylmethyl cation is downright weird. It is well known that both cyclopropylmethyl and cyclobutyl derivatives give very similar product mixture under $\mathrm{S_N1}$ hydrolysis conditions, resulting in both cyclopropylmethyl and cyclobutyl derivatives (see, for example, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951, 73 (6), 2509–2520). This is commonly described by the conjugation in following manner (here, the 1-cyclopropylethyl cation is depicted):

Here bonding of $\ce{C-4}$ with $\ce{C-1}$ and $\ce{C-2}$ can be roughly described as an interaction of the vacant $\mathrm{p}$-orbital of $\ce{C-4}$ with filled orbital of $\pi$-bond between $\ce{C-1}$ and $\ce{C-2}$. It does not matter much, where the original leaving group was - at  $\ce{C-2}$ or $\ce{C-1}$. Since the positive charge is more or less symmetrically distributed between three atoms and the small ring is somewhat relieved of its geometrical strain (both cyclopropane and cyclobutane are very strained molecules, not only due to angle strain, but also considerable steric interactions between hydrogens), the cation has remarkable stability.
Similar effects are common in the chemistry of small bicyclic systems, with norbornane derivitives being the chosen test subjects for decades with the 2-norbornyl cation being probably the most well-known example. March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, 7th ed., Section 10.C.i discusses such nonclassical carbocations in great detail, with the cyclopropylmethyl system being described on pp 404–406.
With further addition of multiple cyclopropyl groups, however, the full conjugation becomes sterically hindered, so extra groups beyond the first have less of an effect. Of course, the stability of these cations is far below that of the tropylium cation, which has very little strain and also possesses aromatic character, distributing the positive charge over seven(!) carbon atoms.  In fact, the stability of the tropylium system is so high, that even the cyclooctatrienyl cation (also known as the homotropylium cation) adopts a similar structure."
What is the pH of ice?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/50704/what-is-the-ph-of-ice,13k,"According to Martin Chaplin's Water Dissociation and pH:

What makes some metals melt at higher temperature?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/141/what-makes-some-metals-melt-at-higher-temperature,58k,"Some factors were hinted, but let me put them in an order of importance and mention some more:

metals generally have a high melting point, because metallic interatomic bonding by delocalized electrons ($\ce{Li}$ having only a few electrons for this ""electron sea"") between core atoms is pretty effective in those pure element solids compared to alternative bonding types (ionic $\pu{6-20 eV/atom}$ bond energy, covalent 1-7, metallic 1-5, van-der-Waals much lower). Also, ionic lattices like $\ce{NaCl}$ have a higher lattice and bonding energy, they have weak interatomic long-range bonding, unlike most metals. They break apart or are easily solvable, metals are malleable but don't break, the electron sea is the reason for their welding ability.
the crystal structure and mass play an inferior role among your filtered elements (just look up the crystal structure of those elements), as metallic bonding is not directional unlike covalent bonding (orbital symmetry). Metals often have half filled $\mathrm{s}$ and $\mathrm{p}$ bands (stronger delocalized than $\mathrm{d}$ and $\mathrm{f}$) at the Fermi-edge (meaning high conductivity) and therefore many delocalised electrons which can move into unoccupied energy states yielding the biggest electron sea with half or less fill bands.   
noble metals like $\ce{Au,Ag}$ have a full $\mathrm{d}$ orbital, therefore low reactivity/electronegativity and are often used as contact materials (high conductivity because of ""very fluid"" electron sea consisting only of $\mathrm{s}$-orbital electrons. Unlike tungsten with half or less occupied $\mathrm{d}$-orbitals they show no interatomic $\mathrm{d-d}$ bonding by delocalized $\mathrm{d}$-electrons, and more importantly, a half filled $\mathrm{d}$-orbital contributes 5 electrons to the energy band, while a $\mathrm{s}$ only 1, $\mathrm{p}$ only 3, the electron sea is bigger among the $\mathrm{d}$-group.
The ""packaging"" of core atoms in the lattice (interatomic distance) among the high $Z$ atoms (compared to e.g. $\ce{Li}$) is denser (more protons, stronger attraction of shell electrons, smaller interatomic radius), means stronger interatomic bonding transmitted by the electron sea: 


You can see here that in each series ($\ce{Li,\ Na,\ K}$) the melting points rise to a maximum and then decrease with increasing atomic number (lacking unoccupied energy states for delocalized $\mathrm{d}$-electrons), bigger electron sea being here a stronger factor than a bit more dense packaging. 

Boron as a semi-metal shows metallic and covalent bonding, Carbon strong directional covalent bonding and is able to build a network of bonds unlike other non-metal elements showing covalent intramolecular bonding, e.g., in diatomic molecules but not strong intermolecular bonding in macromolecules because of lacking unpaired electrons.

So there are some bigger trends for melting points explaining the high melting points of $\mathrm{d}$-metals, but also some minor exceptions to the rule like $\ce{Mn}$."
Is carbon dioxide organic or inorganic?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/22195/is-carbon-dioxide-organic-or-inorganic,63k,"It is entirely arbitrary whether you call it an organic compound or not, though most would not. 
The distinction you make that organic compounds should be found in living things is not a useful criterion. Moreover you are wrong that carbon dioxide isn't: it is both made and used by living things. Animals make it when they metabolise sugars to release energy; plants consume it when they build more complex organic molecules through photosynthesis. In fact most organic molecules are, ultimately, derived from $\ce{CO2}$. 
Even more importantly most molecules considered organic are neither made by nor are found in living things. Chemists make new carbon compounds all the time (tens of millions in the history of chemistry) and most have never been made by animals or plants.
The organic/inorganic terminology is mostly very simple: covalent compounds containing carbon are organic. The only fuzzy area is around very simple molecules like $\ce{CO2}$ where the distinction doesn't matter much. So we would not normally think of diamond or silicon carbide as organic. But we might (though many would not) call calcium carbide organic because it contains a $\ce{C2}$ unit with a carbon-carbon triple bond. 
However since the terminology is mostly very obvious and also somewhat arbitrary, it isn't worth much argument to sort out those very simple but awkward edge cases."

What makes banana bonds possible in diborane?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/228/what-makes-banana-bonds-possible-in-diborane,35k,"Look carefully, it's (distorted) tetrahedral--four groups at nearly symmetrically positions in 3D space{*}. So the hybridization is $sp^3$.

As you can see, the shape is distorted, but it's tetrahedral. Technically, the banana bonds can be said to be made up of orbitals similar to $sp^3$ but not exactly (like two $sp^{3.1}$ and two $sp^{2.9}$ orbitals--since hybridization is just addition of wavefunctions, we can always change the coefficients to give proper geometry). I'm not too sure of this though.
$\ce{B}$ has an $2s^22p^1$ valence shell, so three covalent bonds gives it an incomplete octet. $\ce{BH3}$ has an empty $2p$ orbital. This orbital overlaps the existing  $\ce{B-H}$ $\sigma$ bond cloud (in a nearby $\ce{BH3}$), and forms a 3c2e bond.
It seems that there are a lot more compounds with 3c2e geometry. I'd completely forgotten that there were entire homologous series' under 'boranes' which all have 3c2e bonds (though not the same structure)
And there are Indium and Gallium compounds as well. Still group IIIA, though these are metals. I guess they, like $\ce{Al}$, still form covalent bonds.
So the basic reason for this happening is due to an incomplete octet wanting to fill itself.
Note that ""banana"" is not necessarily only for 3c2e bonds. Any bent bond is called a ""banana"" bond.
Regarding similar structures, $\ce{BeCl2}$ and $\ce{AlCl3}$ come to mind, but both of them have the structure via dative(coordinate) bonds. Additionally, $\ce{BeCl2}$ is planar. 
Sneaks off and checks Wikipedia. Wikipedia says $\ce{Al2(CH3)6}$ is similar in structure and bond type.
I guess we have less such compounds because there are comparatively few elements ($\ce{B}$ group pretty much) with $\leq3$ valence electrons which form covalent bonds(criteria for the empty orbital). Additionally, $\ce{Al}$ is an iffy case--it like both covalent and ionic bonds. Also, for this geometry (either by banana bonds or by dative bonds), I suppose the relative sizes matter as well--since $\ce{BCl3}$ is a monomer even though $\ce{Cl}$ has a lone pair and can form a dative bond.
*Maybe you're used to the view of tetrahedral structure with an atom at the top? Mentally tilt the boron atom till a hydrogen is up top. You should realize that this is tetrahedral as well."
Why is an S-S bond stronger than an O-O bond?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/47056/why-is-an-s-s-bond-stronger-than-an-o-o-bond,31k,"TL;DR: The $\ce{O-O}$ and $\ce{S-S}$ bonds, such as those in $\ce{O2^2-}$ and $\ce{S2^2-}$, are derived from $\sigma$-type overlap. However, because the $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ MOs are also filled, the $\pi$-type overlap also affects the strength of the bond, although the bond order is unaffected. Bond strengths normally decrease down the group due to poorer $\sigma$ overlap. The first member of each group is an anomaly because for these elements, the $\pi^*$ orbital is strongly antibonding and population of this orbital weakens the bond.

Setting the stage
The simplest species with an $\ce{O-O}$ bond would be the peroxide anion, $\ce{O2^2-}$, for which we can easily construct an MO diagram. The $\mathrm{1s}$ and $\mathrm{2s}$ orbitals do not contribute to the discussion so they have been neglected. For $\ce{S2^2-}$, the diagram is qualitatively the same, except that $\mathrm{2p}$ needs to be changed to a $\mathrm{3p}$.

The main bonding contribution comes from, of course, the $\sigma$ MO. The greater the $\sigma$ MO is lowered in energy from the constituent $\mathrm{2p}$ AOs, the more the electrons are stabilised, and hence the stronger the bond.
However, even though the $\pi$ bond order is zero, the population of both $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ orbitals does also affect the bond strength. This is because the $\pi^*$ orbital is more antibonding than the $\pi$ orbital is bonding. (See these questions for more details: 1, 2.) So, when both $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ orbitals are fully occupied, there is a net antibonding effect. This doesn't reduce the bond order; the bond order is still 1. The only effect is to just weaken the bond a little.
Comparing the $\sigma$-type overlap
The two AOs that overlap to form the $\sigma$ bond are the two $\mathrm{p}_z$ orbitals. The extent to which the $\sigma$ MO is stabilised depends on an integral, called the overlap, between the two $n\mathrm{p}_z$ orbitals ($n = 2,3$). Formally, this is defined as
$$S^{(\sigma)}_{n\mathrm{p}n\mathrm{p}} = \left\langle n\mathrm{p}_{z,\ce{A}}\middle| n\mathrm{p}_{z,\ce{B}}\right\rangle = \int (\phi_{n\mathrm{p}_{z,\ce{A}}})^*(\phi_{n\mathrm{p}_{z,\ce{B}}})\,\mathrm{d}\tau$$
It turns out that, going down the group, this quantity decreases. This has to do with the $n\mathrm{p}$ orbitals becoming more diffuse down the group, which reduces their overlap.
Therefore, going down the group, the stabilisation of the $\sigma$ MO decreases, and one would expect the $\ce{X-X}$ bond to become weaker. That is indeed observed for the Group 14 elements. However, it certainly doesn't seem to work here. That's because we ignored the other two important orbitals.
Comparing the $\pi$-type overlap
The answer for our question lies in these two orbitals. The larger the splitting of the $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ MOs, the larger the net antibonding effect will be. Conversely, if there is zero splitting, then there will be no net antibonding effect.
The magnitude of splitting of the $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ MOs again depends on the overlap integral between the two $n\mathrm{p}$ AOs, but this time they are $\mathrm{p}_x$ and $\mathrm{p}_y$ orbitals. And as we found out earlier, this quantity decreases down the group; meaning that the net $\pi$-type antibonding effect also weakens going down the group.
Putting it all together
Actually, to look solely at oxygen and sulfur would be doing ourselves a disservice. So let's look at how the trend continues.
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\mathbf{X} & \mathbf{BDE(X-X)\ /\ kJ\ mol^{-1}} & \mathbf{X} & \mathbf{BDE(X-X)\ /\ kJ\ mol^{-1}} \\
\hline
\ce{O} & 144 & \ce{F} & 158 \\
\ce{S} & 266 & \ce{Cl} & 243 \\
\ce{Se} & 192 & \ce{Br} & 193 \\
\ce{Te} & 126 & \ce{I} & 151 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$
(Source: Prof. Dermot O'Hare's web page.)
You can see that the trend goes this way: there is an overall decrease going from the second member of each group downwards. However, the first member has an exceptionally weak single bond.
The rationalisation, based on the two factors discussed earlier, is straightforward. The general decrease in bond strength arises due to weakening $\sigma$-type overlap. However, in the first member of each group, the strong $\pi$-type overlap serves to weaken the bond.
I also added the Group 17 elements in the table above. That's because the trend is exactly the same, and it's not a fluke! The MO diagram of $\ce{F2}$ is practically the same as that of $\ce{O2^2-}$, so all of the arguments above also apply to the halogens.
How about the double bonds?
In order to look at the double bond, we want to find a species that has an $\ce{O-O}$ bond order of $2$. That's not hard at all. It's called dioxygen, $\ce{O2}$, and its MO scheme is exactly the same as above except that there are two fewer electrons in the $\pi^*$ orbitals.
Since there are only two electrons in the $\pi^*$ MOs as compared to four in the $\pi$ MOs, overall the $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ orbitals generate a net bonding effect. (After all, this is where the second ""bond"" comes from.) Since the $\pi$-$\pi^*$ splitting is much larger in $\ce{O2}$ than in $\ce{S2}$, the $\pi$ bond in $\ce{O2}$ is much stronger than the $\pi$ bond in $\ce{S2}$.
So, in this case, both the $\sigma$ and the $\pi$ bonds in $\ce{O2}$ are stronger than in $\ce{S2}$. There should be absolutely no question now as to which of the $\ce{O=O}$ or the $\ce{S=S}$ bonds is stronger!"
Regioselectivity of acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/4305/regioselectivity-of-acid-catalyzed-ring-opening-of-epoxides,17k,"First part
It won't decide the issue but the Organic Chemistry text by Clayden, Greeves, Warren and Wothers also mentions that the matter might not be as clear-cut as the majority of your textbooks make it seem. This might strengthen the position of the textbook you're using a bit. But again, there are no references given. Here is the relevant passage (especially the last two paragraphs):


Second Part
I have found the following passage on the formation of halohydrins from epoxides in the book by Smith and March (7th Edition), chapter 10-50, page 507:

Unsymmetrical epoxides are usually opened to give mixtures of regioisomers. In a typical reaction, the halogen is delivered to the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide. In the absence of this
structural feature, and in the absence of a directing group, relatively equal mixtures of
regioisomeric halohydrins are expected. The phenyl is such a group, and in 1-phenyl-2-
alkyl epoxides reaction with $\ce{POCl3}/\ce{DMAP}$ ($\ce{DMAP}$ = 4-dimethylaminopyridine) leads to
the chlorohydrin with the chlorine on the carbon bearing the phenyl.${}^{1231}$ When done in an
ionic liquid with $\ce{Me3SiCl}$, styrene epoxide gives 2-chloro-2-phenylethanol.${}^{1232}$ The
reaction of thionyl chloride and poly(vinylpyrrolidinone) converts epoxides to the corresponding
2-chloro-1-carbinol.${}^{1233}$ Bromine with a phenylhydrazine catalyst, however,
converts epoxides to the 1-bromo-2-carbinol.${}^{1234}$ An alkenyl group also leads to a
halohydrin with the halogen on the carbon bearing the $\ce{C=C}$ unit.${}^{1235}$ Epoxy carboxylic
acids are another example. When $\ce{NaI}$ reacts at pH 4, the major regioisomer is the 2-iodo-3-
hydroxy compound, but when $\ce{InCl3}$ is added, the major product is the 3-iodo-2-hydroxy
carboxylic acid.${}^{1236}$

Why is the recipe of Coca Cola still a secret?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15007/why-is-the-recipe-of-coca-cola-still-a-secret,26k,"There are different angles this question can be answered:
Chemical point of view:
A full analysis of a totally unknown mixture is painful and extremely costly. It is always helpful to know how many components you are looking for; what types etc. In this case, it is not enough to analyse the elemental composition or some pure elements, but Coke contains a lot of natural products and mixtures like caramel. Imagine how you identify (and correctly describe the production parameters) caramel in a dilute solution...  Also, liquids with extremely high concentrations of sugar and different acids are unpleasant for analysis, as you often have to separate these main component, so you can identify only small components.
That being said, it is not an impossible task; there are many methods to identify e.g. natural products based on DNA traces. But consider another factor:
Business point of view:
The recipe of Coca Cola itself worth nothing.
Most probably any competent soda maker can make a drink that 99% of the consumers cannot distinguish from Coke by the taste (and could do that decades before). However they don't do because no one would buy a drink that tastes like Coca Cola, but made by others.
The value is in the brand. People buy a fake Rolex if they cannot afford a real. But anyone can afford a Coke- why would buy a fake? If you are in beverage business, it is an imperative to make a drink that is somehow DIFFERENT than the other ones!"
Fundamental forces behind covalent bonding,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/710/fundamental-forces-behind-covalent-bonding,14k,"I understand that covalent bonding is an equilibrium state between attractive and repulsive forces, but which one of the fundamental forces actually causes atoms to attract each other?

The role of Pauli Exclusion in bonding
It is an unfortunate accident of history that because chemistry has a very convenient and predictive set of approximations for understanding bonding, some of the details of why those bonds exist can become a bit hard to discern. It's not that they aren't there -- they most emphatically are! -- but you often have to dig a bit deeper to find them. They are found in physics, in particular in the concept of Pauli exclusion.
Chemistry as avoiding black holes
Let's take your attraction question first. What causes that? Well, in one sense that question is easy: it's electrostatic attraction, the interplay of pulls between positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons.
But even in saying that, something is wrong. Here's the question that points that out: If nothing else was involved except electrostatic attraction, what would be the most stable configuration of two or more atoms with a mix of positive and negative charges?
The answer to that is a bit surprising. If the charges are balanced, the only stable, non-decaying answer for conventional (classical) particles is always the same: ""a very, very small black hole."" Of course, you could modify that a bit by assuming that the strong force is for some reason stable, in which case the answer becomes ""a bigger atomic nucleus,"" one with no electrons around it.
Or maybe atoms as Get Fuzzy?
At this point, some of you reading this should be thinking loudly ""Now wait a minute! Electrons don't behave like point particles in atoms, because quantum uncertainty makes them 'fuzz out' as they get close to the nucleus."" And that is exactly correct -- I'm fond of quoting that point myself in other contexts!
However, the issue here is a bit different, since even ""fuzzed out"" electrons provide a poor barrier for keeping other electrons away by electrostatic repulsion alone, precisely because their charge is so diffuse. The case of electrons that lack Pauli exclusion is nicely captured by Richard Feynman in his Lectures on Physics, in Volume III, Chapter 4, page 4-13, Figure 4-11 at the top of the page. The outcome Feynman describes is pretty boring since atoms would remain simple, smoothly spherical, and about the same size as more and more protons and electrons get added in.
While Feynman does not get into how such atoms would interact, there's a problem there too. Because the electron charges would be so diffuse in comparison to the nuclei, the atoms would pose no real barrier to each other until the nuclei themselves begin to repel each other. The result would be a very dense material that would have more in common with neutronium than with conventional matter.
For now, I'll just forge ahead with a more classical description, and capture the idea of the electron cloud simply by asserting that each electron is selfish and likes to capture as much ""address space"" (see below) as possible.
Charge-only is boring!
So, while you can finagle with funny configurations of charges that might prevent the inevitable for a while by pitting positive against positive and negative against negative, positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons with nothing much else in play will always wind up in the same bad spot: either as very puny black holes or as tiny boring atoms that lack anything resembling chemistry.
A universe full of nothing but various sizes of black holes or simple homogenous neutronium is not very interesting!
Preventing the collapse
So, to understand atomic electrostatic attraction properly, you must start with the inverse issue: What in the world is keeping these things from simply collapsing down to zero size -- that is, where is the repulsion coming from?
And that is your next question:

Also, am I right to think that ""repulsion occurs when atoms are too close together"" comes from electrostatic interaction?

No; that is simply wrong. In the absence of ""something else,"" the charges will wiggle about and radiate until any temporary barrier posed by identical charges simply becomes irrelevant... meaning that once again you will wind up with those puny black holes.
What keeps atoms, bonds, and molecules stable is always something else entirely, a ""force"" that is not traditionally thought of as being a force at all, even though it is unbelievably powerful and can prevent even two nearby opposite electrical charges from merging. The electrostatic force is enormously powerful at the tiny separation distances within atoms, so anything that can stop charged particles from merging is impressive!
The ""repulsive force that is not a force"" is the Pauli exclusion I mentioned earlier. A simple way to think of Pauli exclusion is that identical material particles (electrons, protons, and neutrons in particular) all insist on having completely unique ""addresses"" to tell them apart from other particles of the same type. For an electron, this address includes: where the electron is located in space, how fast and in what direction it is moving (momentum), and one last item called spin, which can only have on of two values that are usually called ""up"" or ""down.""
You can force such material particles (called fermions) into nearby addresses, but with the exception of that up-down spin part of the address, doing so always increases the energy of at least one of the electrons. That required increase in energy, in a nutshell, is why material objects push back when you try to squeeze them. Squeezing them requires minutely reducing the available space of many of the electrons in the object, and those electrons respond by capturing the energy of the squeeze and using it to push right back at you.
Now, take that thought and bring it back to the question about where repulsion comes from when two atoms bond at a certain distance, but no closer. They are the same mechanism!
That is, two atoms can ""touch"" (move so close, but no closer) only because they both have a lot of electrons that require separate space, velocity, and spin addresses. Push them together and they start hissing like cats from two households who have suddenly been forced to share the same house. (If you own multiple cats, you'll know exactly what I mean by that.)
So, what happens is that the overall set of plus-and-minus forces of the two atoms is trying really hard to crush all of the charges down into a single very tiny black hole -- not into some stable state! It is only the hissing and spitting of the overcrowded and very unhappy electrons that keep this event from happening.
Orbitals as juggling acts
But just how does that work?
It's sort of a juggling act, frankly. Electrons are allowed to ""sort of"" occupy many different spots, speeds, and spins (mnemonic $s^3$, and no, that is not standard, I'm just using it for convenience in this answer only) at the same time, due to quantum uncertainty. However, it's not necessary to get into that here beyond recognizing that every electron tries to occupy as much of its local $s^3$ address space as possible.
Juggling between spots and speeds requires energy. So, since only so much energy is available, this is the part of the juggling act that gives atoms size and shape. When all the jockeying around wraps up, the lowest energy situations keep the electrons stationed in various ways around the nucleus, not quite touching each other. We call those special solutions to the crowding problem orbitals, and they are very convenient for understanding and estimating how atoms and molecules will combine.
Orbitals as specialized solutions
However, it's still a good idea to keep in mind that orbitals are not exactly fundamental concepts, but rather outcomes of the much deeper interplay of Pauli exclusion with the unique masses, charges,  and configurations of nuclei and electrons. So, if you toss in some weird electron-like particle such as a muon or positron, standard orbital models have to be modified significantly, and applied only with great care. Standard orbitals can also get pretty weird just from having unusual geometries of fully conventional atomic nuclei, with the unusual dual hydrogen bonding found in boron hydrides such as diborane probably being the best example. Such bonding is odd if viewed in terms of conventional hydrogen bonds, but less so if viewed simply as the best possible ""electron juggle"" for these compact cases.
""Jake! The bond!""
Now on to the part that I find delightful, something that underlies the whole concept of chemical bonding.
Do you recall that it takes energy to squeeze electrons together in terms of the main two parts of their ""addresses,"" the spots (locations) and speeds (momenta)? I also mentioned that spin is different in this way: the only energy cost for adding two electrons with different spin addresses is that of conventional electrostatic repulsion. That is, there is no ""forcing them closer"" Pauli exclusion cost as you get for locations and velocities.
Now you might think, ""but electrostatic repulsion is huge!"", and you would be exactly correct. However, compared to the Pauli exclusion ""non-force force"" cost, the energy cost of this electrostatic repulsion is actually quite small -- so small that it can usually be ignored for small atoms. So when I say that Pauli exclusion is powerful, I mean it, since it even makes the enormous repulsion of two electrons stuck inside the same tiny sector of a single atom look so insignificant that you can usually ignore its impact!
But that's secondary because the real point is this: When two atoms approach each other closely, the electrons start fighting fierce energy-escalation battles that keep both atoms from collapsing all the way down into a black hole. But there is one exception to that energetic infighting: spin! For spin and spin alone, it becomes possible to get significantly closer to that final point-like collapse that all the charges want to do.
Spin thus becomes a major ""hole"" -- the only such major hole -- in the ferocious armor of repulsion produced by Pauli exclusion. If you interpret atomic repulsion due to Pauli exclusion as the norm, then spin-pairing two electrons becomes another example of a ""force that is not a force,"" or a pseudo force. In this case, however, the result is a net attraction. That is, spin-pairing allows two atoms (or an atom and an electron) to approach each other more closely than Pauli exclusion would otherwise permit. The result is a significant release of electrostatic attraction energy. That release of energy in turn creates a stable bond since it cannot be broken unless that same energy is returned.
Sharing (and stealing) is cheaper
So, if two atoms (e.g. two hydrogen atoms) each have an outer orbital that contains only one electron, those two electrons can sort of look each other over and say, ""you know, if you spin downwards and I spin upwards, we could both share this space for almost no energy cost at all!"" And so they do, with a net release of energy, producing a covalent bond if the resulting spin-pair cancels out positive nuclear charges equally on both atoms.
However, in some cases, the ""attractive force"" of spin-pairing is so overwhelmingly greater for one of the two atoms that it can pretty much fully overcome (!) the powerful electrostatic attraction of the other atom for its own electron. When that happens, the electron is simply ripped away from the other atom. We call that an ionic bond, and we act as it if it's no big deal. But it is truly an amazing thing, one that is possible only because of the pseudo force of spin-pairing.
Bottom line: Pseudo forces are important!
My apologies for having given such a long answer, but you happened to ask a question that cannot be answered correctly without adding in some version of Pauli ""repulsion"" and spin-pair ""attraction."" For that matter, the size of an atom, the shape of its orbitals, and its ability to form bonds similarly all depend on pseudo forces."
How can I predict if a reaction will occur between any two (or more) substances?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/50684/how-can-i-predict-if-a-reaction-will-occur-between-any-two-or-more-substances,80k,"Can I predict the products of any chemical reaction?
In theory, yes!
Every substance has characteristic reactivity behavior. Likewise pairs and sets of substances have characteristic behavior. For example, the following combinations of substances only have one likely outcome each:
$$
\ce{HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H2O} \\[2ex]
\ce{CH3CH2CH2OH->[$1.$ (COCl)2, (CH3)2SO][$2.$ Et3N] CH3CH2CHO}
$$
However, it is not a problem suited to brute force or exhaustive approaches
There are millions or perhaps billions of known or possible substances. Let's take the lower estimate of 1 million substances. There are $999\,999\,000\,000$ possible pairwise combinations. Any brute force method (in other words a database that has an answer for all possible combinations) would be large and potentially resource prohibitive. Likewise you would not want to memorize the nearly 1 trillion combinations.
If more substances are given, the combination space gets bigger. In the second example reaction above, there are four substances combined: $\ce{CH3CH2CH2OH}$, $\ce{(COCl)2}$, $\ce{(CH3)2SO}$, and $\ce{Et3N}$. Pulling four substances at random from the substance space generates a reaction space on the order of $1\times 10^{24}$ possible combinations. And that does not factor in order of addition. In the second reaction above, there is an implied order of addition:

$\ce{CH3CH2CH2OH}$
$\ce{(COCl)2}$, $\ce{(CH3)2SO}$
$\ce{Et3N}$

However, there are $4!=24$ different orders of addition for four substances, some of which might not generate the same result. Our reaction space is up to $24\times 10^{24}$, a bewildering number of combinations. And this space does not include other variables, like time, temperature, irradiation, agitation, concentration, pressure, control of environment, etc. If each reaction in the space could somehow be stored for as little as 100 kB of memory, then the whole space of combinations up to 4 substances would require $2.4 \times 10^{27}$ bytes of data, or $2.4\times 10^7$ ZB (zettabytes) or $2.4\times 10^4$ trillion terabytes. The total digital data generated by the human species was estimated recently (Nov. 2015) to be 4.4 ZB. We need $5.5\times 10^5$ times more data in the world to hold such a database. And that does not even count the program written to search it or the humans needed to populate it, the bandwidth required to access it, or the time investment of any of these steps.
In practice, it can be manageable!
Even though the reaction space is bewilderingly huge, chemistry is an orderly predictable business. Folks in the natural product total synthesis world do not resort to random combinations and alchemical mumbo jumbo. They can predict with some certainty what type of reactions do what to which substances and then act on that prediction.
When we learn chemistry, we are taught to recognize if a molecule belongs to a certain class with characteristic behavior. In the first example above, we can identify $\ce{HCl}$ as an acid and $\ce{NaOH}$ as a base, and then predict an outcome that is common to all acid-base reactions. In the second example above, we are taught to recognize $\ce{CH3CH2CH2OH}$ as a primary alcohol and the reagents given as an oxidant. The outcome is an aldehyde. 
These examples are simple ones in which the molecules easily fit into one class predominantly. More complex molecules may belong to many categories. Organic chemistry calls these categories “Functional Groups”. The ability to predict synthetic outcomes then begins and ends with identifying functional groups within a compound's structure. For example, even though the following compound has a more complex structure, it contains a primary alcohol, which will be oxidized to an aldehyde using the same reagents presented above. We can also be reasonably confident that no unpleasant side reactions will occur. 

If the reagents in the previous reaction had been $\ce{LiAlH4}$ followed by $\ce{H3O+}$, then more than one outcome is possible since more than one functional group in the starting compound will react. Controlling the reaction to give one of the possible outcomes is possible, but requires further careful thought. 
There are rules, but they are not few in number. There are too many classes of compounds to list here. Likewise even one class, like primary alcohols (an hydroxyl group at the end of a hydrocarbon chain) has too many characteristic reactions to list here. If there are 30 classes of compounds (an underestimate) and 30 types of reactions (an underestimate), then there are 900 reaction types (an underestimate). The number of viable reaction types is more manageable than the total reaction space, but would still be difficult to commit to memory quickly. And new reaction types are being discovered all the time.
Folks who learn how to analyze combinations of compounds spend years taking courses and reading books and research articles to accumulate the knowledge and wisdom necessary. It can be done. Computer programs can be (and have been) designed to do the same analysis, but they were designed by people who learned all of the characteristic combinations. There is no shortcut."
Why does wood burn but not sugar?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/103777/why-does-wood-burn-but-not-sugar,11k,"Combustion is a gas phase reaction. The heat of the flame vapourises the substrate and it's the vapour that reacts with the air. That's why heat is needed to get combustion started.
Anyhow, wood contains lots of relatively volatile compounds so it's not too hard to get combustion started. Once combustion has started the heat of the flame keeps the reaction going.
However sugar dehydrates and emits water when you heat it. Water isn't flammable (obviously) so there's no way to get combustion started. Dehydration leaves behind pure carbon and that is non-volatile so again there's no way to get this to burn. Carbon will burn of course, but you need a high temperature to get it going."
Why do the names of most chemical elements end with -um or -ium?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/2832/why-do-the-names-of-most-chemical-elements-end-with-um-or-ium,61k,"To expand on @BelieveInvis's answer -- in the early 19th century, when the Royal Society was really in the swing of things, the dominant language of scholarship was still Latin. Since Latin didn't have words for the new metallic elements, new words were coined from the existing terms for the substances and given Latinate endings. 
From the OED's entry on -ium:
The Latin names of metals were in -um, e.g. aurum, argentum, ferrum; the names of sodium, potassium, and magnesium, derived from soda, potassa or potash, and magnesia, were given by Davy in 1807, with the derivative form -ium; and although some of the later metals have received names in -um, the general form is in -ium, as in cadmium, iridium, lithium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, titanium, uranium; in conformity with which aluminum has been altered to aluminium.
So, I think after that, other elements were simply given the suffix to fit the generally useful naming scheme, and then, metal names which were already in common use kept their common language names (e.g. gold as opposed to aurum) simply by force of usage."
"Why does bond angle decrease in the order H2O, H2S, H2Se?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14981/why-does-bond-angle-decrease-in-the-order-h2o-h2s-h2se,91k,"Here are the $\ce{H-X-H}$ bond angles and the $\ce{H-X}$ bond lengths:

\ce{H2S} &  92.3 & 134 \\
\ce{H2Se}&  91.0 & 146 \\
\hline
\end{array}
The traditional textbook explanation would argue that the orbitals in the water molecule is close to being $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized, but due to lone pair - lone pair electron repulsions, the lone pair-X-lone pair angle opens up slightly in order to reduce these repulsions, thereby forcing the $\ce{H-X-H}$ angle to contract slightly. So instead of the $\ce{H-O-H}$ angle being the perfect tetrahedral angle ($109.5^\circ$) it is slightly reduced to $104.5^\circ$.  On the other hand, both $\ce{H2S}$ and $\ce{H2Se}$ have no orbital hybridization.  That is, The $\ce{S-H}$ and $\ce{Se-H}$ bonds use pure $\ce{p}$-orbitals from sulfur and selenium respectively.  Two $\ce{p}$-orbitals are used, one for each of the two $\ce{X-H}$ bonds; this leaves another $\ce{p}$-orbital and an $\ce{s}$-orbital to hold the two lone pairs of electrons.  If the $\ce{S-H}$ and $\ce{Se-H}$ bonds used pure $\ce{p}$-orbitals we would expect an $\ce{H-X-H}$ interorbital angle of $90^\circ$.  We see from the above table that we are very close to the measured values.  We could fine tune our answer by saying that in order to reduce repulsion between the bonding electrons in the two $\ce{X-H}$ bonds the angle opens up a bit wider.  This explanation would be consistent with the $\ce{H-S-H}$ angle being slightly larger than the corresponding $\ce{H-Se-H}$ angle. Since the $\ce{H-Se}$ bond is longer then the $\ce{H-S}$ bond, the interorbital electron repulsions will be less in the $\ce{H2Se}$ case alleviating the need for the bond angle to open up as much as it did in the $\ce{H2S}$ case.
The only new twist on all of this that some universities are now teaching is that water is not really $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized, the $\ce{sp^3}$ explanation does not fit with all of the experimentally observed data, most notably the photoelectron spectrum.  The basic concept introduced is that ""orbitals only hybridize in response to bonding."" So in water, the orbitals in the two $\ce{O-H}$ bonds are roughly $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized, but one lone pair resides in a nearly pure p-orbital and the other lone pair is in a roughly $\ce{sp}$ hybridized orbital."
Mechanism of arene side chain oxidation by permanganate,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/79/mechanism-of-arene-side-chain-oxidation-by-permanganate,30k,"Some general information on side-chain oxidation in alkylbenzenes is available at Chemguide:

An alkylbenzene is simply a benzene ring with an alkyl group attached
  to it. Methylbenzene is the simplest alkylbenzene.
Alkyl groups are usually fairly resistant to oxidation. However, when they are attached to a benzene ring, they are easily oxidised by
  an alkaline solution of potassium manganate(VII) (potassium
  permanganate).
Methylbenzene is heated under reflux with a solution of potassium
  manganate(VII) made alkaline with sodium carbonate. The purple colour
  of the potassium manganate(VII) is eventually replaced by a dark brown
  precipitate of manganese(IV) oxide.
The mixture is finally acidified with dilute sulfuric acid.
Overall, the methylbenzene is oxidised to benzoic acid.

Interestingly, any alkyl group is oxidised back to a -COOH group on
  the ring under these conditions. So, for example, propylbenzene is
  also oxidised to benzoic acid.


Regarding the mechanism, a Ph.D. student at the University of British Columbia did his doctorate on the mechanisms of permanganate oxidation of various organic substrates.1 Quoting from the abstract:

It was found that the most vigorous oxidant was the permanganyl ion ($\ce{MnO3+}$), with some contributing oxidation by both permanganic acid ($\ce{HMnO4}$) and permanganate ion ($\ce{MnO4-}$) in the case of easily oxidized compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, or enols.

The oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid was one of the reactions investigated, and a proposed reaction mechanism (on pp 137–8) was as follows. In the slow step, the active oxidant $\ce{MnO3+}$ abstracts a benzylic hydrogen from the organic substrate.

$$\begin{align}
\ce{2H+ + MnO4- &<=> MnO3+ + H2O} & &\text{(fast)} \\
\ce{MnO3+ + PhCR2H &-> [PhCR2^. + HMnO3+] & &\text{(slow)}} \\
\ce{[PhCR2^. + HMnO3+] &-> PhCR2OH + Mn^V} & &\text{(fast)} \\
\ce{PhCR2OH + Mn^{VII} &-> aldehyde or ketone} & &\text{(fast)} \\
\ce{aldehyde + Mn^{VII} &-> benzoic acid} & &\text{(fast)} \\
\ce{ketone + Mn^{VII} &-> benzoic acid} & &\text{(slow)} \\
\ce{5 Mn^V &-> 2Mn^{II} + 3Mn^{VII}} & &\text{(fast)}
\end{align}$$

The abstraction of a benzylic hydrogen atom is consistent with the fact that arenes with no benzylic hydrogens, such as tert-butylbenzene, do not get oxidised.

Does oil break down condoms?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5844/does-oil-break-down-condoms,51k,"First off, may I say that I applaud your decision to test this through an experiment. It's rare to see that than I would like.
Now, on to the matter at hand. It's fairly well known from industrial chemistry that non-polar solvents degrade latex quite heavily.
I work with latex seals a lot, and the hexanes we use routinely break the seals down in under a day. Of course, if you're lubricating your condoms with hexanes, you're a) an idiot or b) absolutely insane.
A paper I managed to find suggests that there really isn't too much direct data on condoms, and it muses that the warnings might have arisen from industry, where nonpolar solvents decidedly do degrade latex. 
To find out, they did a burst experiment with condoms that had been treated with various oils. Glycerol and Vaseline-treated condoms showed a very, very minor decrease in strength, while mineral oil/baby oil-treated ones burst at less than 10% of the volume of an untreated condom.
They also found that 10 month-old condoms have half the burst volume of 1-month old ones, so you could argue that using 1-month-old condoms that have been slathered in Vaseline is still much safer than using older ones.
As for the actual chemistry of the weakening, I honestly don't know. If I were to hazard a guess, I would note that the latex looks like a bunch of ethylenes glued together, 
so my guess would be that the solvents get between the chains and force them apart, weakening them. For this to happen, the solvent must be nonpolar, but still small enough to slip between the chains of the polymer.
That's probably why vaseline and canola oil don't have much of an effect---they're just too big to fit between the chains. Again though, I don't know for sure, so don't quote me on this last paragraph."
Why does cyclopropane react with bromine?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10653/why-does-cyclopropane-react-with-bromine,22k,"The following ring opening reaction will occour:


You are quite right about the angle strain. Because orbital interactions are not optimal in this geometry. Consider p-orbitals, then a natural bond angle would be $\theta\in [90^\circ; 180^\circ]$. A mixing of s- and p-type orbitals allows a wide range of angles $\theta\in (90^\circ,\dots, 180^\circ)$.
In cyclopropane $\ce{C3H6}$ - which you can also describe as trimethylene $\ce{(CH2)3}$ -  bonds have to be bent to overlap at all. A possible way of describing the bonding situation is regarding each $\ce{CH2}$ entity as $\mathrm{sp^2}$ hybridised. Two of these orbitals are used for $\ce{C-H}$ bonds (not shown) and one forms an inner two-electron-three-centre σ bond (left). This leaves p-orbitals to form some kind of degenerate π-like orbitals (middle, right). 

This very general approach can be derived from a Walsh diagram. Schwarz et.al. {@academia.edu} and Hoffmann {@roaldhoffmann.com} described bonding quite similar and it is in quite good agreement with a calculation (BP86/cc-PVTZ, $D_\mathrm{3h}$) I have done. From this I have prepared a chart of all occupied molecular orbitals formed from valence orbitals and the LUMO. Here is a preview. Each orbital is viewed from three different angles:

Especially the symmetrical orbital 8 resembles very well the schematics. A quite rigorous approach for this theory can also be found here.
It is noteworthy - as mentioned by ron - that there is no notable increase in electron density in the centre of the ring. This may be due to the fact that there are much more orbitals having nodes in the centre than there are without.

Now bromine is known to be easily polarised $\ce{{}^{\delta+}Br-Br^{\delta-}}$ and may intercept at any point of the ring causing a bond break and relaxation to a less strained structure. It will most likely attack at the the $\pi$ type orbitals since bromine is an electrophile. The mechanism is analogous to the addition of bromine to ethene, which is nicely described at chemguide.co.uk. The essential part is the attack of the bromine at the HOMO(s).

The ring opening reaction can be reversed by adding sodium.
However, when there are bromine radicals present (UV light) then substitution will occur:
\begin{aligned}\ce{
Br2 &->[\ce{h\nu}] 2Br.\\
&+(CH2)3 -> (CH2)2(CHBr) + HBr

How can carbon dioxide be converted into carbon and oxygen?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/915/how-can-carbon-dioxide-be-converted-into-carbon-and-oxygen,95k,"In my opinion, the catalytic, solar-driven conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol, formic acid, etc. is much more interesting and promising, but since Enrico asked for the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon itself:
The group around Yutaka Tamaura was/is active in this field. In one of their earlier publications,[1] they heated magnetite ($\ce{Fe3O4}$) at 290 °C for 4 hours in a stream of hydrogen to yield a material which turned out to be stable at room temperature under nitrogen. This material, $\ce{Fe_{3+\delta}O4}$ $(\delta=0.127)$, i.e. the metastable cation-excess magnetite is able to incorporate oxygen in the form of $\ce{O^2-}$. 
Under a $\ce{CO2}$ atmosphere, the oxygen-deficient material converted to ""ordinary"" $\ce{Fe3O4}$ with carbon deposited on the surface.
This remarkable reaction however is not catalytic, but a short recherche showed that the authors have published a tad more in this field. Maybe somebody else finds a a report on a catalytic conversion among their publications.

Why does alcoholic KOH prefer elimination whereas aqueous KOH prefers substitution?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15728/why-does-alcoholic-koh-prefer-elimination-whereas-aqueous-koh-prefers-substituti,52k,"$$\ce{R-OH + OH- <=> RO- + H2O }$$
In alcoholic solution, the $\ce{KOH}$ is basic enough ($\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}} =15.74$) to deprotonate a small amount of the alcohol molecules ($\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}}= 16–17$), thus forming alkoxide salts ($\ce{ROK}$). The alkoxide anions $\ce{RO-}$ are not only more basic than pure $\ce{OH-}$ but they are also bulkier (how much bulkier depends on the alkyl group). The higher bulkiness makes $\ce{RO-}$ a worse nucleophile than $\ce{OH-}$ and the higher basicity makes it better at E2 eliminations."
"Why does sulfur, but not oxygen, catenate?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/431/why-does-sulfur-but-not-oxygen-catenate,12k,"First, a note: while oxygen has fewer allotropes than sulfur, it sure has more than two! These include $\ce{O}$, $\ce{O_2}$, $\ce{O_3}$, $\ce{O_4}$, $\ce{O_8}$, metallic $\ce{O}$ and four other solid phases. Many of these actually have a corresponding sulfur variant. However, you are right in a sense that sulfur has more tendency to catenate… let's try to see why!
Here are the values of the single and double bond enthalpies:
$$\begin{array}{ccc} \hline
\text{Bond} & \text{Dissociation energy / }\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\ \hline
\ce {O-O} & 142 \\
\ce {S–S} & 268 \\
\ce {O=O} & 499 \\
\ce {S=S} & 352 \\ \hline
\end{array}$$
This means that $\ce{O=O}$ is stronger than $\ce{S=S}$, while $\ce{O–O}$ is weaker than $\ce{S–S}$. So, in sulfur, single bonds are favoured and catenation is easier than in oxygen compounds.
It seems that the reason for the weaker $\ce{S=S}$ double bonds has its roots in the size of the atom: it's harder for the two atoms to come at a small enough distance, so that the $\mathrm{3p}$ orbitals overlap is small and the $\pi$ bond is weak. This is attested by looking down the periodic table: $\ce{Se=Se}$ has an even weaker bond enthalpy of $\ce{272 kJ/mol}$. There is more in-depth discussion of the relative bond strengths in this question.
While not particularly stable, it's actually also possible for oxygen to form discrete molecules with the general formula $\ce{H-O_n-H}$; water and hydrogen peroxide are the first two members of this class, but $n$ goes up to at least $5$. These ""hydrogen polyoxides"" are described further in this question."
Why does whipped cream use nitrous oxide instead of nitrogen gas?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/76505/why-does-whipped-cream-use-nitrous-oxide-instead-of-nitrogen-gas,12k,"There are two ways to efficiently make an aerosol product:

Use a gas that liquifies under the pressure inside the can. For example, butane lighters. Nitrogen is one of the ""fixed gases"", meaning it's a gas under most conditions (but take a look at the temperatures and pressures needed for liquid nitrogen—it's not going to ever be found in consumer products).

or

Use a gas that is highly soluble in the liquid (carrier) and that will ""substantially"" vaporize when the higher pressure inside the can is reduced to atmospheric.

The US government restricts the pressures that can be used in aerosol cans (and requires 100% quality control testing—when's the last time you heard of an aerosol can exploding? [although it does happen]). If you cut up a can, you'll notice that it's pretty flimsy. The higher the pressure (and a gas that has been dissolved in a liquid doesn't exert much pressure), the more expensive it will be to build the container (aerosol can).
Thus, the fixed gases are almost never used, except in some medical products. Why? Because they just aren't soluble enough to help move the liquid (or, in other cases, solid) out of the can and also to disperse it into a very fine mist. The customer wants basically one thing when using an aerosol: uniform, consistent spray from first to last drop. Using a very soluble gas helps, and using one with a boiling point near room temperature also helps. But the laws of thermodynamics say that the temperature of the can will drop as you spray out its contents. This may dramatically interfere with the liquid-to-gas phase change, while solubility is less sensitive to temperature. The trick is to make a product (and I've made some) that sprays out consistently and also doesn't leave so much left behind in the can that the customer feels ripped off."
Inductive effect of hydrogen isotopes,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/20405/inductive-effect-of-hydrogen-isotopes,26k,"Yes, it has a lot to do with mass.  Since deuterium has a higher mass than protium, simple Bohr theory tells us that the deuterium 1s electron will have a smaller orbital radius than the 1s electron orbiting the protium nucleus (see ""Note"" below for more detail on this point). The smaller orbital radius for the deuterium electron translates into a shorter (and stronger) $\ce{C-D}$ bond length.
A shorter bond has less volume to spread the electron density (of the 1 electron contributed by $\ce{H}$ or $\ce{D}$) over resulting in a higher electron density throughout the bond, and, consequently, more electron density at the carbon end of the bond. Therefore, the shorter $\ce{C-D}$ bond will have more electron density around the carbon end of the bond, than the longer $\ce{C-H}$ bond. 
The net effect is that the shorter bond with deuterium increases the electron density at carbon, e.g. deuterium is inductively more electron donating than protium towards carbon.
Similar arguments can be applied to tritium and it's even shorter $\ce{C-T}$ bond should be even more inductively electron donating towards carbon than deuterium.
Note: Bohr Radius Detail
Most introductory physics texts show the radius of the $n^\text{th}$ Bohr orbit to be given by
$$r_{n} = {n^2\hbar^2\over Zk_\mathrm{c} e^2 m_\mathrm{e}}$$
where $Z$ is the atom's atomic number, $k_\mathrm{c}$ is Coulomb's constant, $e$ is the electron charge, and $m_\mathrm{e}$ is the mass of the electron.  However, in this derivation it is assumed that the electron orbits the nucleus and the nucleus remains stationary.  Given the mass difference between the electron and nucleus, this is generally a reasonable assumption.  However, in reality the nucleus does move too.  It is relatively straightforward to remove this assumption and make the equation more accurate by replacing $m_\mathrm{e}$ with the electron's reduced mass, $\mu_\mathrm{e}$ 
$$\mu_\mathrm{e} = \frac{m_\mathrm{e}\times m_\text{nucleus}}{m_\mathrm{e} + m_\text{nucleus}}$$
Now the equation for the Bohr radius becomes
$$r_{n} = {n^2\hbar^2\over Zk_\mathrm{c} e^2 \mu_\mathrm{e}}$$
Since the reduced mass of an electron orbiting a heavy nucleus is always larger than the reduced mass of an electron orbiting a lighter nucleus 
$$r_\text{heavy} \lt r_\text{light}$$
and consequently an electron will orbit closer to a deuterium nucleus than it will orbit a protium nucleus."

The reason behind the steep rise in pH in the acid base titration curve,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/8057/the-reason-behind-the-steep-rise-in-ph-in-the-acid-base-titration-curve,53k,"I've decided to tackle this question in a somewhat different manner. Instead of giving the chemical intuition behind it, I wanted to check for myself if the mathematics actually work out. As far as I understand, this isn't done often, so that's why I wanted to try it, even though it may not make the clearest answer. It turns out to be a bit complicated, and I haven't done much math in a while, so I'm kinda rusty. Hopefully, everything is correct. I would love to have someone check my results. 
My approach here is to explicitly find the equation of a general titration curve and figure out from that why the pH varies quickly near the equivalence point. For simplicity, I shall consider the titration to be between a monoprotic acid and base. Explicitly, we have the following equilibria in solution
$$\ce{HA <=> H^+ + A^-} \ \ \ → \ \ \ K_\text{a} = \ce{\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}}$$
$$\ce{BOH <=> B^+ + OH^-} \ \ \ → \ \ \ K_\text{b} = \ce{\frac{[OH^-][B^+]}{[BOH]}}$$
$$\ce{H2O <=> H^+ + OH^-} \ \ \ → \ \ \ K_\text{w} = \ce{[H^+][OH^-]}$$
Let us imagine adding two solutions, one of the acid $\ce{HA}$ with volume $V_\text{A}$ and concentration $C_\text{A}$, and another of the base $\ce{BOH}$ with volume $V_\text{B}$ and concentration $C_\text{B}$. Notice that after mixing the solutions, the number of moles of species containing $\ce{A}$ ($\ce{HA}$ or $\ce{A^-}$) is simply $n_\text{A} = C_\text{A} V_\text{A}$, while the number of moles of species containing $\ce{B}$ ($\ce{BOH}$ or $\ce{B^+}$) is $n_\text{B} = C_\text{B} V_\text{B}$. Notice that at the equivalence point, $n_\text{A} = n_\text{B}$ and therefore $C_\text{A} V_\text{A} = C_\text{B} V_\text{B}$; this will be important later. We will assume that volumes are additive (total volume $V_\text{T} = V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}$), which is close to true for relatively dilute solutions.
In search of an equation
To solve the problem of finding the final equilibrium after adding the solutions, we write out the charge balance and matter balance equations:
Charge balance: $\ce{[H^+] + [B^+] = [A^-] + [OH^-]}$
Matter balance for $\ce{A}$: $\displaystyle \ce{[HA] + [A^-]} = \frac{C_\text{A} V_\text{A}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}}$
Matter balance for $\ce{B}$: $\displaystyle \ce{[BOH] + [B^+]} = \frac{C_\text{B} V_\text{B}} {V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}}$
A titration curve is given by the pH on the $y$-axis and the volume of added acid/base on the $x$-axis. So what we need is to find an equation where the only variables are $\ce{[H^+]}$ and $V_\text{A}$ or $V_\text{B}$. By manipulating the dissociation constant equations and the mass balance equations, we can find the following:
$$\ce{[HA]} = \frac{\ce{[H^+][A^-]}}{K_\text{a}}$$ $$\ce{[BOH]} = \frac{\ce{[B^+]}K_\text{w}}{K_\text{b}\ce{[H^+]}}$$ $$\ce{[A^-]} = \frac{C_\text{A} V_\text{A}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}} \left(\frac{K_\text{a}}{K_\text{a} + \ce{[H^+]}}\right)$$ $$\ce{[B^+]} = \frac{C_\text{B} V_\text{B}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}} \left(\frac{K_\text{b}\ce{[H^+]}}{K_\text{b}\ce{[H^+]} + K_\text{w}}\right)$$
Replacing those identities in the charge balance equation, after a decent bit of algebra, yields:
$$\ce{[H^+]^4} + \left(K_\text{a} + \frac{K_\text{w}}{K_\text{b}} + \frac{C_\text{B} V_\text{B}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}}\right) \ce{[H^+]^3} + \left(\frac{K_\text{a}}{K_\text{b}}K_\text{w} + \frac{C_\text{B} V_\text{B}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}} K_\text{a} - \frac{C_\text{A} V_\text{A}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}}K_\text{a} - K_\text{w}\right) \ce{[H^+]^2} - \left(K_\text{a} K_\text{w} + \frac{C_\text{A} V_\text{A}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}}\frac{K_\text{a}}{K_\text{b}} K_\text{w} + \frac{K^2_\text{w}}{K_\text{b}}\right) \ce{[H^+]} - \frac{K_\text{a}}{K_\text{b}} K^2_\text{w} = 0$$
Now, this equation sure looks intimidating, but it is very interesting. For one, this single equation will exactly solve any equilibrium problem involving the mixture of any monoprotic acid and any monoprotic base, in any concentration (as long as they're not much higher than about $1~\mathrm{\small M}$) and any volume. Though it doesn't seem to be possible to separate the variables $\ce{[H^+]}$ and $V_\text{A}$ or $V_\text{B}$, the graph of this equation represents any titration curve (as long as it obeys the previous considerations). Though in its full form it is quite daunting, we can obtain some simpler versions. For example, consider that the mixture is of a weak acid and a strong base. This means that $K_\text{b} \gg 1$, and so every term containing $K_\text{b}$ in the denominator is approximately zero and gets cancelled out. The equation then becomes:
Weak acid and strong base:
$$\ce{[H^+]^3} + \left(K_\text{a} + \frac{C_\text{B} V_\text{B}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}}\right) \ce{[H^+]^2} + \left(\frac{C_\text{B} V_\text{B}}{V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B}} K_\ce{a} - \frac{C_\ce{A} V_\ce{A}}{V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B}}K_\ce{a} - K_\ce{w}\right) \ce{[H^+]} - K_\ce{a} K_\ce{w} = 0$$
For a strong acid and weak base ($K_\text{a} \gg 1$), you can divide both sides of the equation by $K_\text{a}$, and now all terms with $K_\text{a}$ in the denominator get cancelled out, leaving:
Strong acid and weak base:
$$\ce{[H^+]^3} + \left(\frac{K_\ce{w}}{K_\ce{b}}+\frac{C_\ce{B}V_\ce{B}}{V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B}} - \frac{C_\ce{A} V_\ce{A}}{V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B}}\right) \ce{[H^+]^2} - \left(K_\ce{w} + \frac{C_\text{A} V_\ce{A}}{V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B}} \frac{K_\ce{w}}{K_\ce{b}}\right) \ce{[H^+]} - \frac{K^2_\ce{w}}{K_\ce{b}} = 0$$
The simplest case happens when adding a strong acid to a strong base ($K_\ce{a} \gg 1$ and $K_\ce{b} \gg 1$), in which case all terms containing either in the denominator get cancelled out. The result is simply:
Strong acid and strong base:
$$\ce{[H^+]^2} + \left(\frac{C_\text{B} V_\text{B}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}} - \frac{C_\text{A} V_\text{A}}{V_\text{A} + V_\text{B}}\right) \ce{[H^+]} - K_\ce{w} = 0$$
It would be enlightening to draw some example graphs for each equation, but Wolfram Alpha only seems to be able to handle the last one, as the others require more than the standard computation time to display. Still, considering the titration of $1~\text{L}$ of a $1~\ce{\small M}$ solution of a strong acid with a $1~\ce{\small M}$ solution of a strong base, you get this graph. The $x$-axis is the volume of base added, in litres, while the $y$-axis is the pH. Notice that the graph is exactly as what you'll find in a textbook!
Now what?
With the equations figured out, let's study how they work. We want to know why the pH changes quickly near the equivalence point, so a good idea is to analyze the derivative of the equation and figure out where they have a very positive or very negative value, indicating a region where $\ce{[H^+]}$ changes quickly with a slight addition of an acid/base.
Suppose we want to study the titration of an acid with a base. What we need then is the derivative $\displaystyle \frac{\ce{d[H^+]}}{\ce{d}V_\ce{B}}$. We will obtain this by implicit differentiation of both sides of the equations by $\displaystyle \frac{\ce{d}}{\ce{d}V_\ce{B}}$. Starting with the easiest case, the mixture of a strong acid and strong base, we obtain:
$$\frac{\ce{d[H^+]}}{\ce{d} V_\ce{B}}=  \frac{K_\ce{w} - C_\ce{B} \ce{[H^+] - [H^+]^2}}{2(V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B}\left) \ce{[H^+]} + (C_\ce{B} V_\ce{B} - C_\ce{A} V_\ce{A}\right)}$$
Once again a complicated looking fraction, but with very interesting properties. The numerator is not too important, it's the denominator where the magic happens. Notice that we have a sum of two terms ($2(V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B})\ce{[H^+]}$ and $(C_\ce{B} V_\ce{B} - C_\ce{A} V_\ce{A})$). The lower this sum is, the higher $\displaystyle \frac{\mathrm{d}\ce{[H^+]}}{\mathrm{d} V_\ce{B}}$ is and the quicker the pH will change with a small addition of the base. Notice also that, if the solutions aren't very dilute, then the second term quickly dominates the denominator because while adding base, the value of $[H^+]$ will become quite small compared to $C_\ce{A}$ and $C_\ce{B}$. Now we have a very interesting situation; a fraction where the major component of the denominator has a subtraction. Here's an example of how this sort of function behaves. When the subtraction ends up giving a result close to zero, the function explodes. This means that the speed at which $\ce{[H^+]}$ changes becomes very sensitive to small variations of $V_\ce{B}$ near the critical region. And where does this critical region happen? Well, close to the region where $C_\ce{B} V_\ce{B} - C_\ce{A} V_\ce{A}$ is zero. If you remember the start of the answer, this is the equivalence point!. So there, this proves mathematically that the speed at which the pH changes is maximum at the equivalence point.
This was only the simplest case though. Let's try something a little harder. Taking the titration equation for a weak acid with strong base, and implicitly differentiating both sides by $\displaystyle \frac{\ce{d}}{\ce{d} V_\ce{B}}$ again, we get the significantly more fearsome:
$$\displaystyle \frac{\ce{d[H^+]}}{\ce{d}V_\ce{B}} = \frac{ -\frac{V_\ce{A}}{(V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B})^2} \ce{[H^+]} (C_\ce{B}\ce{[H^+]} - C_\ce{B} K_\ce{a} + C_\ce{A} K_\ce{a})}{3\ce{[H^+]^2 + 2[H^+]}\left(K_\ce{a} + \frac{C_\ce{B} V_\ce{B}}{V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B}}\right) + \frac{K_\ce{a}}{V_\ce{A} + V_\ce{B}} (C_\ce{B} V_\ce{B} - C_\ce{A} V_\ce{A}) -K_\ce{w}}$$
Once again, the term that dominates the behaviour of the complicated denominator is the part containing $C_\ce{B} V_\ce{B} - C_\ce{A} V_\ce{A}$, and once again the derivative explodes at the equivalence point."

Differences between phenols and alcohols,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/729/differences-between-phenols-and-alcohols,89k,"Nope. Alcohols consist of an -$\ce{OH}$ group bonded to a saturated carbon ($\mathrm{sp^3}$ hybridized, no multiple bonds).
IUPAC says:

alcohols
Compounds in which a hydroxy group, -$\ce{OH}$, is attached to a saturated carbon atom $\ce{R3COH}$. The term 'hydroxyl' refers to the radical species, $\ce{HO^.}$.

and

phenols
Compounds having one or more hydroxy groups attached to a benzene or other arene ring, e.g., 2-naphthol:

(source: iupac.org)

A phenol consists of an -$\ce{OH}$ bonded to an unsaturated $\mathrm{sp^2}$ carbon. Thus, it does not qualify as an alcohol. One can classify it as an enol, though.

Really, to me, the classification doesn't matter. Classifications are artificial, what is important is, how well the properties fit in the classification.
Many of the alcohol properties depend upon:

Its unsaturated nature: oxidation to ketone/aldehyde/acid
The weaker $\ce{R-O}$ bond and its ability to easily break and form an $\ce{R+}$ cation (this makes it a good participant in $\mathrm{S_N1}$ reactions)

Phenol can obviously not be oxidised at the $\ce{OH}$ to a ketone/acid (though one can do stuff to make it into a quinone). Phenylic carbocations are unstable, thus we don't get any $\mathrm{S_N1}$ reactions, and the $\ce{Ph-O}$ bond stays put.
On the other hand, most of the reactions of phenol depend upon its

Aromatic phenyl ring: All the EAS reactions
Weaker $\ce{O-H}$ bond (i.e., acidic nature): Reimer-Tiemann reaction, etc.

Thus phenols and alcohols don't have too many reactions in common. So, in this case, they have been classified in a sensible manner--if phenols were classified as alcohols, we would basically be clubbing two radically different classes of compounds under one umbrella."
Why is BCl3 a monomer whereas AlCl3 exists as a dimer?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34842/why-is-bcl3-a-monomer-whereas-alcl3-exists-as-a-dimer,25k,"Introduction
The bonding situation in $\ce{(AlCl3)2}$ and $\ce{(BCl3)2}$ is nothing trivial and the reason why aluminium chloride forms dimers, while boron trichloride does not, cannot only be attributed to size.
In order to understand this phenomenon we need to look at both, the monomers and the dimers, and compare them to each other.
Understanding the respective bonding situation of the monomers, is key to understand which deficiencies lead to dimerisations.
Computational details
Since I was unable to find any compelling literature on the subject, I ran some calculations of my own. I used the DF-M06L/def2-TZVPP for geometry optimisations. Each structure has been optimised to a local minimum in their respective symmetry restrictions, i.e. $D_\mathrm{3h}$ for the monomers and $C_\mathrm{2v}$ for the dimers.
Analyses with the Natural Bond Orbital model (NBO6 program) and the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM, MultiWFN) have been run on single point energy calculations at the M06/def2-QZVPP//DF-M06-L/def2-TZVPP level of theory.
A rudimentary energy decomposition analysis has been done on that level, too.
Energy decomposition analysis
The dissociation energy of the dimers $\ce{(XY3)2}$ to the monomers $\ce{XY3}$ is defined as the difference of the energy of the dimer $E_\mathrm{opt}[\ce{(XY3)2}]$ and double the energy of the monomer $E_\mathrm{opt}[\ce{XY3}]$ at their optimised (relaxed) geometries $\eqref{e-diss-def}$.
The interaction energy is defined as the difference of energy of the relaxed dimer and double the energy of the monomers in the geometry of the dimer $E_\mathrm{frag}[\ce{(XY3)^{\neq}}]$ $\eqref{e-int-def}$. That basically means breaking the molecule in two parts, but keeping these fragments in the same geometry.
The deformation energy (or preparation energy) is defined as the difference of the energy of the optimised and the non-optimised monomer $\eqref{e-def-def}$. This is the energy required to distort the monomer (in its ground state) to the configuration it will have in the dimer.

Results & Discussion
The Monomers $\ce{XCl3; X{=}\{B,Al\}}$.
Let's just get the obvious out of the way: Boron is (vdW-radius 205 pm) smaller than aluminium (vdW-radius 240 pm). For comparison chlorine has a vdW-radius of 205 pm, too. That is pretty much reflected in the bond lengths and the chlorine-chlorine distance.
\begin{array}{llrrr}\hline

From this data we can draw certain conclusions without further looking. The boron monomer is much more compact than the aluminium monomer. When we compare the bond lengths to the covalent radii (Pyykkö and Atsumi) we find that the boron chloride bond is about the length that we would expect from a double bond ($\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{doub}(\ce{B}) + \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{doub}(\ce{Cl}) = 173~\pu{pm}$). While the aluminium chloride bond is still significantly shorter than a single bond ($\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{sing}(\ce{Al}) + \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{sing}(\ce{Cl}) = 225~\pu{pm}$), it is still also much longer than a double bond ($\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{doub}(\ce{Al}) + \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{doub}(\ce{Cl}) = 191~\pu{pm}$).
This itself offers compelling evidence, that there is more π-backbonding in $\ce{BCl3}$ than in $\ce{AlCl3}$. Molecular orbital theory offers more evidence for this. In both compounds is a doubly occupied π orbital. The following pictures are for a contour value of 0.05; aluminium (left/top) and boron (right/bottom)


In numbers, the main contributions are as follows (this is just a representation, not the actual formula):
$$\begin{align}
\pi(\ce{BCl3}) &= 
   21\%~\ce{p_{$z$}-B} + \sum_{i=1}^3 26\%~\ce{p_{$z$}-Cl^{$(i)$}}\\
\pi(\ce{AlCl3}) &= 
   13\%~\ce{p_{$z$}-Al} + \sum_{i=1}^3 29\%~\ce{p_{$z$}-Cl^{$(i)$}}
\end{align}$$
There is still some more evidence. The natural atomic charges (NPA of NBO6) fairly well agree with that assesment; aluminium is far more positive than boron.
$$\begin{array}{lrr}
                    & \ce{AlCl3} & \ce{BCl3}\\\hline

%\mathbf{q}(\ce{Cl})~\text{[QTAIM]} & -0.8       & -0.7     \\\hline
\end{array}$$
The analysis in terms of QTAIM also shows that the bonds in $\ce{AlCl3}$ they are predominantly ionic (left/top) while in $\ce{BCl3}$ are predominantly covalent (right/bottom).


One final thought on the bonding can be supplied with a natural resonance theory analysis (NBO6). I have chosen the following starting configurations and let the program calculate their contribution. 

The overall structures in terms of resonance are the same for both cases, that is if you force resonance treatment of the aluminium monomer. Structure A does not contribute, while the others contribute to about 31%. However, when not forced into resonance, structure A is the best approximation of the bonding situation for $\ce{AlCl3}$. In the case of $\ce{BCl3}$ the algorithm finds a hyperbond between the chlorine atoms, a strongly delocalised bond between multiple centres. In this case these are 3-centre-4-electron bonds between the chlorine atoms, resulting from the higher lying degenerated π orbitals.

This all is quite good evidence that the monomer of boron chloride should be more stable towards dimerisation than the monomer of aluminium.
The Dimers $\ce{(XCl3)2; X{=}\{B,Al\}}$.
The obvious change is that the co-ordination of the central elements goes from trigonal planar to distorted tertrahedral. A look at the geometries will give us something to talk about.

\end{array}
In principle nothing much changes other than the expected elongation of the bonds that are now bridging. In case of aluminium the stretch is just below 10% and for boron it is slightly above 14%, having a bit more impact. In the boron dimer also the terminal bonds are slightly (> +1%) affected, while for aluminium there is almost no change.
The charges are not really a reliable tool, especially when they are that close to zero as they are for boron. In both cases one can see that charge density is transferred from the bridging chlorine to the central $\ce{X}$.

\end{array}$$
A look at the central four-membered-ring of in terms of QTAIM offers that the overall bonding does not change. In aluminium they get a little more ionic, while in boron they stay largely covalent.


The NBO analysis offers a maybe quite surprising result. There are no hyperbonds in any of the dimers. While a description in these terms is certainly possible, after all it is just an interpretation tool, it is completely unnecessary. So after all we have two kinds of bonds in the dimers four terminal $\ce{X-Cl}$ and four bridging $\ce{X-{\mu}Cl}$ bonds. Therefore the most accurate description is with formal charges (also the simplest). The notation with the arrows is not wrong, but it does not represent the fact that the bonds are equal for symmetry reasons alone.

To make this straight: There are no hyperbonds in $\ce{(XCl3)2; X{=}\{B,Al\}}$; this includes three-centre-two-electron bonds, and three-centre-four-electron bonds. And deeper insight to those will be offered on another day.
The differentiation between a dative bond and some other for of bond does not make sense, as the bonds are equal and only introduced by a deficiency of the used description model.
A natural resonance theory for $\ce{(BCl3)2}$ gives us a overall contribution of the main (all single bonds) structure of 46%; while all other structure do contribute, there are too many and their contribution is too little (> 5%). I did not run this analysis for the aluminium case as I did not expect any more insight and I did not want to waste calculation time.
Dimerisation - yes or no
The energies offer us a clear trend. Aluminium likes to dimerise, boron not. However, there are still some things to discuss. I am going to argue for the reaction 
$$\begin{align}
\ce{2XCl3 &-> (XCl3)2}&
\Delta E-\mathrm{diss}/E_\mathrm{o}/H/G&.
\end{align};$$
therefore if reaction energies are negative the dimerisation is favoured.
The following table includes all calculated energies, including the energy decomposition analysis mentioned at the beginning. All energies are given in $\pu{kJ mol^-1}$.
\begin{array}{lrcrcrcrr}
 \Delta & E_\mathrm{diss} &(& E_\mathrm{int} &+2\times& E_\mathrm{def}&)& E_\mathrm{o} &H &G\\\hline
\ce{Al} & -113.5 &(& -224.2 &+2\times& 55.4&)& -114.7 & -60.4 & -230.4\\ 
\ce{B}  &   76.4 &(& -111.2 &+2\times& 93.8&)&   82.6 & -47.1 &  152.5\\\hline
\end{array}
The result is fairly obvious at first. The association for aluminium is strongly exergonic, while for boron it is strongly endergonic. While both reactions should be exothermic, stronger for aluminium, the trend for the observed electronic energies ($E_\mathrm{o}$ including the zero-point energy correction) and the (electronic) dissociation energies reflect the overall trend for the Gibbs enthalpies. 
While it is fairly surprising how strongly entropy favours association of $\ce{AlCl3}$, it is also surprising how it strongly disfavours it for $\ce{BCl3}$.
A look at the decomposed electronic energy offers great insight into the reasons why one dimer is stable and the other not (at room temperature).
The interaction energy of the fragments is double for aluminium than it is for boron. This can be traced back to the very large difference in the atomic partial charges. One could expect that the electrostatic energy is a lot more attractive for aluminium than it is for boron.
The deformation energy on the other hand clearly reflects the changes in the geometry discussed above. For aluminium there is a smaller penalty resulting from the elongation of the $\ce{Al-Cl}$ bond and pyramidalisation. For boron on the other hand this has a 1.5 times larger effect. The distortion also weakens the π-backbonding, which the additional bonding would need to compensate.
The four-membered-ring is certainly not an ideal geometry and the bridging chlorine atoms come dangerously close.
Conclusion, Summary and TL;DR:
The distortion of the geometry of the monomer $\ce{BCl3}$ cannot be compensated by the additional bonding between the two fragments. Therefore the monomers are more stable than the dimer. Additionally entropy considerations at room temperature favour the monomer, too.
On the other hand, the distortion of the molecular geometry in $\ce{AlCl3}$ is less severe. The gain in interaction energy of the two fragments well overcompensates for the change. Entropy also favours the dimerisation.
While size of the central atom is certainly the distinguishing factor, its impact is only severe on  the electronic structure. Steric crowding would not be a problem when the interaction energy would compensate for that. This is quite evident because $\ce{BCl3}$ is still a very good Lewis acid and forms stable compounds with much larger moieties than itself.

"What causes the ""rotting fish smell""?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/99659/what-causes-the-rotting-fish-smell,12k,"The ""fishy"" odor that you're familiar with is brought about by a whole bunch of compounds, and not any single one. Then again, if we were to narrow this down a bit, we could say that simple nitrogen compounds are the main culprits.  
But suppose we want to blame only a single compound for the delightfully pungent odor of rotting fish, and we couldn't be bothered with the nuances of olfactory physiology or food chemistry to go through a list of compounds running into the hundreds (if not thousands). In that case, we can pin the blame on trimethylamine (TMA).

With regard to fish, the TMA is a result of the degradation of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) present in the body fluids (blood, lymph, excreta) of the fish.
Just so you don't get the wrong idea, TMAO is present in the body fluids of all vertebrates ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶n̶k̶ ̶o̶f̶, not just fish (albeit in much lower concentrations, which is why you don't mistake ground chicken for tuna).

Now why is TMAO more abundant in fish?
Ever tried to pickle a cucumber (or anything for that matter)? Notice that the cucumber shrivels up over time? It's losing water to the pickling fluid by a process known as exosmosis: the water is drawn out from a less concentrated environment (cucumber's tissue) to a more concentrated one (pickling fluid).
 Disclaimer: As user @lly pointed out in the comments, this particular bit has the potential to cause a bit of confusion. The inside of a cell (the cytoplasm I mean) is technically an aqueous colloidal solution (the pickling fluid is an aqueous solution as well). In the context of aqueous solutions, ""concentration"" is an indication of how much solute is present, not water. So in this context, if something is more concentrated, it has less water in it 



Now the same thing is going to want to happen to a fish in salt water, which isn't so nice from the fish's perspective.
To counter the outflow of water, a fish has a significantly higher concentration of the familiar metabolite urea in its body fluids (as compared to terrestrial vertebrates). This establishes a situation where the fish's body fluids have roughly the same ""concentration"" as the salt water it swims in (the more correct term here would be ""osmolarity"", in place of ""concentration"")
That urea, if left to its own devices, will seek to destabilize  macromolecular structures and inhibit cellular functions; the TMAO present alongside the urea helps counteract those detrimental effects.
Of course, going by this logic, saltwater fish should have a much stronger ""fish odor"" than freshwater fish (which is certainly the case).
Lets not forget the classic kitchen tip: Rubbing fish with something acidic like vinegar, b̶a̶t̶t̶e̶r̶y̶ ̶a̶c̶i̶d̶ or lemon juice helps reduce the odor (the TMA degrades under acidic conditions).

Also, some of you might know that a fish-like smell is observed in rancid food. That, apparently, is the result of the oxidation of omega-3 fatty acids."

Does it need to be at $25~^\circ\mathrm{C}$?


No. $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ$ can be defined at any temperature you wish to define it at, since the standard state does not prescribe a particular temperature. If you change the temperature, $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ$ will change.


Does $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ = \Delta_\mathrm{r} H^\circ - T\Delta_\mathrm{r} S^\circ$ always use $T = 298~\mathrm{K}$?


No. You use whatever temperature you are running your reaction at.


(...maths...)


Yes, at equilibrium, $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G = 0$ and $Q = K$.
However, everything after the first bullet point is wrong. You cannot conclude that $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ = 0$, nor can you conclude that $K = 1$. The equation $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ = -RT \ln K$ does not analogously translate into $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G = -RT \ln Q$! The accurate relation is:
$$\Delta_\mathrm{r} G = \Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ + RT\ln Q$$
Setting $Q = K$ and $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G = 0$ in this equation does not tell you anything about the value of $K$. In fact, if you try doing it, all you will find out is that $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ = -RT \ln K$ - no surprises there!

Long answer
Any book that writes that $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ$ is the ""special case"" of $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G$ at $T = 298~\mathrm{K}$ is wrong.
The Gibbs free energy of a system is defined as follows:
$$G = H - TS$$
Under constant temperature and pressure (from now on, I will just assume constant $T$ and $p$ without stating it), all systems will seek to minimise their Gibbs free energy. Equilibrium is reached when $G$ is minimised. When $G$ is at a minimum, any infinitesimal change in $G$, i.e. $\mathrm{d}G$, will be $0$. Therefore, this is equivalent to saying that the condition for chemical equilibrium is $\mathrm{d}G = 0$.
Clearly, we need a way to relate this quantity $\mathrm{d}G$ to the actual reactants and products that are in the system. This can be done by using the Maxwell relation (see any physical chemistry text for details):
$$\mathrm{d}G = V\,\mathrm{d}p - S\,\mathrm{d}T + \sum_i \mu_i\,\mathrm{d}n_i$$
Under constant $T$ and $p$, $\mathrm{d}p = \mathrm{d}T = 0$ and therefore
$$\mathrm{d}G = \sum_i \mu_i\,\mathrm{d}n_i$$
where $\mu_i$ is the chemical potential of species $i$, defined as a partial derivative:
$$\mu_i = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial n_i}\right)_{n_{j\neq i}}$$
So, we now have a refined condition for equilibrium:
$$\mathrm{d}G = \sum_i \mu_i\,\mathrm{d}n_i = 0$$
We can go further by noting that the values of $\mathrm{d}n_i$ for different components $i$, $j$, etc. are not unrelated. For example, if we have a reaction $i + j \longrightarrow k$, then for each mole of $i$ that is consumed, we must also use up one mole of $j$; this means that $\mathrm{d}n_i = \mathrm{d}n_j$.
This can be formalised using the idea of a stoichiometric coefficient $\nu_i$, which is defined to be positive for products and negative for reactants. For example, in the reaction
$$\ce{3H2 + N2 -> 2NH3}$$
we have $\nu_{\ce{H2}} = -3$, $\nu_{\ce{N2}} = -1$, and $\nu_{\ce{NH3}} = 2$.
By stoichiometry, if $1.5~\mathrm{mol}$ of $\ce{H2}$ is consumed, then $1~\mathrm{mol}$ of $\ce{NH3}$ has to be produced. We could write $\Delta n_{\ce{H2}} = -1.5~\mathrm{mol}$ and $\Delta n_{\ce{NH3}} = 1~\mathrm{mol}$. These quantities are proportional to their stoichiometric coefficients:
$$\frac{\Delta n_{\ce{H2}}}{\nu_{\ce{H2}}} = \frac{-1.5~\mathrm{mol}}{-3} = 0.5~\mathrm{mol} = \frac{1~\mathrm{mol}}{2} = \frac{\Delta n_{\ce{NH3}}}{\nu_{\ce{NH3}}}$$
The quantity $0.5~\mathrm{mol}$ is a constant for all chemical species $\ce{J}$ that participate in the reaction, and it is called the ""extent of reaction"" and denoted $\Delta \xi$ (that is the Greek letter xi). If the reaction is going forward, then $\Delta \xi$ is positive, and if the reaction is going backwards, then $\Delta \xi$ is negative. If we generalise the above result, we can write
$$\Delta \xi = \frac{\Delta n_i}{\nu_i}$$
and if we make $\Delta n_i$ smaller and smaller until it becomes an infinitesimal, then:
$$\begin{align}
\mathrm{d}\xi &= \frac{\mathrm{d}n_i}{\nu_i} \\
\mathrm{d}n_i &= \nu_i\,\mathrm{d}\xi
\end{align}$$
If we go back to our condition for equilibrium, we can substitute in the above to get:
$$\mathrm{d}G = \sum_i \mu_i\nu_i\,\mathrm{d}\xi = 0$$
Now, $\mathrm{d}\xi$ is no longer dependent on $i$, since we have established already that $\Delta \xi$ (and by extension $\mathrm{d}\xi$) is a constant for all chemical species. So, we can ""divide through"" by it to get:
$$\Delta_\mathrm{r} G \equiv \frac{\mathrm{d}G}{\mathrm{d}\xi} = \sum_i \mu_i\nu_i = 0$$
where $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G$ is defined to be $\mathrm{d}G/\mathrm{d}\xi$.
Note that $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G$ is an intensive property and has units of $\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}$, since $\mathrm{d}\xi$ has units of $\mathrm{mol}$. This ensures that the units we use are consistent: since we know that $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G = \Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ + RT\ln Q$, $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G$ must have the same units as $RT$.
How do we interpret the physical significance of $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G$, or in other words, what does it even mean? There are two ways, each based on a different mathematical expression.

We have $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G = \sum \nu_i \mu_i$. This means that $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G$ is simply the difference between the chemical potentials of the products and the reactants, weighted by their stoichiometric coefficients. For the reaction $\ce{3H2 + N2 -> 2NH3}$, we have:

$$\Delta_\mathrm{r} G = \sum_i \mu_i\nu_i = 2\mu_{\ce{NH3}} - 3\mu_{\ce{H2}} -\mu_{\ce{N2}}$$

We have $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G = \mathrm{d}G/\mathrm{d}\xi$. This means that it is the slope of a curve of $G$ against $\xi$:


Note that up to this point, we have not stipulated any particular temperature, pressure, amounts of species present, or any conditions whatsoever. We have only said that the temperature and pressure must be constant.
It is important to realise that $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G$ is a well-defined quantity at all $T$, all $p$, and all possible values of $n_i, n_j, \cdots$! The shape of the curve will change when you vary the conditions. However, no matter what the curve looks like, it is always possible to find its gradient ($= \Delta_\mathrm{r}G$) at a particular point.

What exactly, then, is $\Delta G^\circ$? It is just a special case of $\Delta G$, where all the reactants and products are prepared in a standard state. According to IUPAC, the standard state is defined as:

For a gas: pure ideal gas when the pressure $p$ is equal to the standard pressure $p^\circ$.
For a liquid or solid: pure liquid or solid at $p = p^\circ$
For a solution: ideal solution when the concentration $c$ is equal to the standard concentration $c^\circ$.

$p^\circ$ is most commonly taken to be $\pu{1 bar}$, although older texts may use the value $\pu{1 atm} = \pu{1.01325 bar}$. Since 1982, IUPAC has recommended the value $\pu{1 bar}$ for the standard pressure (Pure Appl. Chem. 1982, 54 (6), 1239–1250; DOI: 10.1351/pac198254061239). However, depending on the context, a different value of $p^\circ$ may prove to be more convenient. Likewise, $c^\circ$ is most commonly – but not necessarily – taken to be $\pu{1 mol dm-3}$.
Note that in the above definitions, no temperature is specified. Therefore, by defining the standard Gibbs free energy, we are fixing a particular value of $p$, as well as particular values of $n_i, n_j, \cdots$. However, the value of $T$ is not fixed. Therefore, when stating a value of $\Delta_\mathrm rG^\circ$, it is also necessary to state the temperature which that value applies to.
When a reaction vessel is prepared with all its substances in the standard state, all the components of the system will have an activity of exactly $1$ by definition. Therefore, the reaction quotient $Q$ (which is a ratio of activities) will also be exactly equal to $1$. So, we could also say that $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G^\circ$ is the value of $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G$ when $Q = 1$.
Returning to the graph of $G$ against $\xi$ above, we note that at the left-most point, $Q = 0$ since there are only reactants; at the right-most point, $Q \to \infty$ as there are only products. As we move from left to right, $Q$ increases continuously, so there must be a point where $Q = 1$. (In general, the point where $Q = 1$ will not be the same as the equilibrium point.) Since $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G$ is the gradient of the graph, $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G^\circ$ is simply the gradient of the graph at that particular point where $Q = 1$:

The gradient of the graph, i.e. $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G$, will vary as you traverse the graph from left to right. At equilibrium, the gradient is zero, i.e. $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G = 0$. However, $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G^\circ$ refers to the gradient at that one specific point where $Q = 1$. In the example illustrated above, that specific gradient is negative, i.e. $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G^\circ < 0$.
Again, I reiterate that the temperature has nothing to do with this. If you were to change the temperature, you would get an entirely different graph of $G$ versus $\xi$. You can still find the point on that graph where $Q = 1$, and the gradient of that graph at the point where $Q = 1$ is simply $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ$ at that temperature.

We have established the qualitative relationship between $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G$ and $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ$, but it is often useful to have an exact mathematical relation.
$\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ$ is exactly the same as $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G$ except for the imposition of the standard state. It follows that if we take the equation
$$\Delta_\mathrm{r} G = \sum_i \mu_i \nu_i$$
and impose the standard state, we get
$$\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ = \sum_i \mu_i^\circ \nu_i$$
Thermodynamics tells us that
$$\mu_i = \mu_i^\circ + RT\ln{a_i}$$
where $a_i$ is the thermodynamic activity of species $i$. Substituting this into the expressions for $\Delta G$ and $\Delta G^\circ$ above, we obtain the result:
$$\Delta_\mathrm{r} G = \Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ + RT\ln Q$$
where the reaction quotient $Q$ is defined as
$$Q = \prod_i a_i^{\nu_i}$$
When equilibrium is reached, we necessarily have $\Delta_\mathrm{r} G = 0$ (see the discussion above). The equilibrium constant $K$ is defined to be the value of $Q$ at equilibrium. Therefore, at equilibrium, $Q = K$. Plugging this into the equation above gives us the famous equation:
$$\Delta_\mathrm{r} G^\circ = -RT\ln K$$

I'll explain why it's often true, and give a counter-example at the end.

Your majority component B and the impurity (let's call it A) form a binary system. In most cases, such binary mixtures exhibit a solid–liquid phase diagram as follows:

(image taken from these lecture notes).
This binary phase diagram has pure A on the left, pure B on the right. A and B form, somewhere, a eutectic. It is the point here at concentration e and temperature y. Because the existence of a eutectic point is guaranteed for any A/B binary system, and because the eutectic corresponds to a lower temperature, your liquidus curve decreases with increasing impurity concentration, and the impurity thus lowers the melting point.
However, not all binary mixtures form a eutectic. In the words of Wikipedia:

Not all binary alloys have a eutectic point; for example, in the silver-gold system the melt temperature (liquidus) and freeze temperature (solidus) both increase monotonically as the mix changes from pure silver to pure gold.

The corresponding phase diagram is as follows:"
Why do SN1 and SN2 reactions not occur at sp2 centres?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14482/why-do-sn1-and-sn2-reactions-not-occur-at-sp2-centres,73k,"Sometimes, especially in introductory courses the instructor will try to keep things ""focused"" in order to promote learning.  Still, it's unfortunate that the instructor couldn't respond in a more positive and stimulating way to your question. 
These reactions do occur at $\ce{sp^2}$ hybridized carbon atoms, they are often just energetically more costly, and therefore somewhat less common. Consider when a nucleophile reacts with a carbonyl compound, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon atom in an $\ce{S_{N}2}$ manner.  The electrons in the C-O $\pi$–bond can be considered as the leaving group and a tetrahedral intermediate is formed with a negative charge on oxygen. It is harder to do this with a carbon-carbon double bond (energetically more costly) because you would wind up with a negative charge on carbon (instead of oxygen), which is energetically less desirable (because of the relative electronegativities of carbon and oxygen).

If you look at the Michael addition reaction, the 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to the carbon-carbon double bond in an $\ce{\alpha-\beta}$ unsaturated carbonyl system, this could be viewed as an $\ce{S_{N}2}$ attack on a carbon-carbon double bond, but again, it is favored (lower in energy) because you create an intermediate with a negative charge on oxygen.

$\ce{S_{N}1}$ reactions at $\ce{sp^2}$ carbon are well documented.  Solvolysis of vinyl halides in very acidic media is an example.  The resultant vinylic carbocations are actually stable enough to be observed using nmr spectroscopy.  The picture below helps explain why this reaction is so much more difficult (energetically more costly) than the more common solvolysis of an alkyl halide.  In the solvolysis of the alkyl halide we produce a traditional carbocation with an empty p orbital.  In the solvolysis of the vinyl halide we produce a carbocation with the positive charge residing in an $\ce{sp^2}$ orbital. Placing positive charge in an $\ce{sp^2}$ orbital is a higher energy situation compared to placing it in a p orbital (electrons prefer to be in orbitals with higher s density, it stabilizes them because the more s character in an orbital the lower its energy; conversely, in the absence of electrons, an orbital prefers to have high p character and mix the remaining s character into other bonding orbitals that do contain electrons in order to lower their energy)."
Why is the vanadium(3+) ion paramagnetic?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/148/why-is-the-vanadium3-ion-paramagnetic,83k,"In addition to the general rules of how electronic configurations of atoms and ions are calculated, the elements from the $\mathrm{d}$-block (a.k.a. the transition metals) obey one special rule:

In general, electrons are removed from the valence-shell $\mathrm{s}$-orbitals before they are removed from valence $\mathrm{d}$-orbitals when transition metals are ionized.

(I took this formulation from these online lecture notes, but you will find equivalent statements in your textbooks.)
So, what that does mean is that if you remove electrons from vanadium(0), you will remove the $\mathrm{4s}$ electrons before you remove the $\mathrm{3d}$-electrons. So, you have the following electronic configurations:

$\ce{V}$ is $\ce{[Ar]} \mathrm{4s^2 3d^3}$
$\ce{V^2+}$ is $\ce{[Ar]} \mathrm{4s^0 3d^3}$
$\ce{V^3+}$ is $\ce{[Ar]} \mathrm{4s^0 3d^2}$
$\ce{V^4+}$ is $\ce{[Ar]} \mathrm{4s^0 3d^1}$
$\ce{V^5+}$ is $\ce{[Ar]} \mathrm{4s^0 3d^0}$

And thus, $\ce{V^3+}$ is paramagnetic, because it has two unpaired $\mathrm{3d}$-electrons. In fact, all the ions above are paramagnetic, except $\ce{V^5+}$."
Can 100% covalent bonds exist?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32306/can-100-covalent-bonds-exist,12k,"According to Pauling's famous The Nature of the Chemical Bond , 3rd edition, at page 73:

In the hydrogen molecule a quantum-mechanical treatment has shown that the two ionic structures $\ce{H+H-}$ and $\ce{H- H+}$ enter into resonance with the extreme covalent structure $\ce{H-H}$ only to a small extent, each ionic structure contributing only about 2 percent to the normal state of the molecule. 

He goes on to state that other diatomics such as chlorine should have even less ionic character.

How can the dipole moment of carbon monoxide be rationalised by molecular orbital theory?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/30797/how-can-the-dipole-moment-of-carbon-monoxide-be-rationalised-by-molecular-orbita,25k,"Unfortunately, nothing in the bonding situation in carbon monoxide is easily explained, especially not the dipole moment. According to the electronegativities of the elements, you would expect the partial positive charge to be at the carbon and a partial negative charge at oxygen. However, this is not the case, which can only be explained by molecular orbital theory. A complete analysis of this can be found in Gernot Frenking, Christoph Loschen, Andreas Krapp, Stefan Fau,  and Steven H. Strauss, J. Comp. Chem., 2007, 28 (1), 117-126. (I believe it is available free of charge.)
Responsible for the dipole moment is the highest occupied molecular orbital, a $\pmb{\sigma}$ orbital, which has its largest coefficient at the carbon atom. In first order approximation, this orbital can be considered the lone pair of carbon. All other valence orbitals are more strongly polarised towards the oxygen. The orbital that can in first order approximation be considered as the oxygen lone pair has almost only s character and therefore contributes only little to the dipole moment.

I have reproduced the MO scheme of carbon monoxide for you below. Please note, that the blue/orange coloured orbitals are virtual (unoccupied) orbitals, which should be taken with a grain of salt.

There are two possible decomposition schemes to explain the bonding, both of them involve donor-acceptor interactions. The term ""dative bonding"" should be avoided here, it is better to use it only for bonds, that consist purely of donor-acceptor interactions, as for example in $\ce{H3N\bond{->}BH3}$.
Below, the two decomposition schemes are reproduced from figure 6 (b & c) in the linked paper. Please note, that this decomposition does not include hybridised orbitals. 

The left decomposition is a better description, since it retains the $C_{\infty{}v}$ symmetry of the molecule. We can see a donor-acceptor $\sigma$ bond and two electrons sharing $\pi$ bonds.
In the right configuration we assume an electron sharing $\sigma$ bond, an electron sharing $\pi$ bond and a donor-acceptor $\pi$ bond.  
It is very important to understand, that the concept of a dative bond, that you are trying to employ here is only right by coincidence. The reason that the dipole moment is oriented towards the carbon is only to find in the weakly bonding HOMO, the lone pair of carbon."
Is it safe to drink reboiled water?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/50511/is-it-safe-to-drink-reboiled-water,57k,"Reboiling water will do precisely three things:

Some volatile contaminants in the water that survived the first boiling might be driven out by the second boiling.
Some additional evaporation will occur, causing anything dissolved in the water (salts, contaminants) to be slightly more concentrated.
Some additional material from the surface of the vessel you're boiling the water in might dissolve into the water.

It's virtually impossible to imagine any scenario in which this would matter, unless you were taking a huge amount of barely drinkable water and boiling away most of it or using a vessel whose lining could produce toxins in your water. Needless to say, you really shouldn't be drinking barely drinkable water at all, nor should you be boiling water even once in a vessel whose lining can produce toxins. If you're doing these kinds of things, the additional risk from reboiling would be miniscule.
It will definitely not summon aresenic or lead from nowhere."
Why can a diamond be broken using a hammer if it's the hardest natural substance known?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/102971/why-can-a-diamond-be-broken-using-a-hammer-if-its-the-hardest-natural-substance,21k,"Hardness and toughness are not the same
Hardness and toughness are very different qualities in materials and are weakly related.
Hardness is strongly related to the more well-defined quantity of stiffness which measures how easily a compound can be deformed under stress. Glass and diamond are very stiff materials, for example. If you try to poke them with something they resist deforming to accommodate your poke. (Hardness is not perfectly aligned to stiffness because of small scale microstructures in many materials, but this is good enough for now).
Toughness is a vaguer term for materials and there isn't a simple way to measure it. This is partially because it varies depending on circumstances in a way that stiffness does not and it is a property of the overall structure and not just the materials that make up the structure. Understanding it requires some insight into why things break (and why other things don't). we need to know a lot about the small scale structure of materials not just the substances involved. For example, stainless steel (used in knives and forks) is a well-known tough material but cast iron is brittle. Both are mostly made of iron. The differences are in the crystalline structures.
One key property of tough structures is that cracks don't propagate. So a stick of glass will break easily as will a glass fibre. But a bundle of glass fibres embedded in an epoxy resin can be very tough (because the cracks in individual glass fibres are not propagated through the epoxy resin). Some tough metals can adjust the micro defects in their crystalline structures to absorb the strain that would otherwise propagate cracks. Some very soft compounds are very tough because the deform so easily that it is hard to start cracks, nylon rope for example.
Diamond is very very stiff. But it has no protection mechanism against cracks. So, like glass, once a crack has started it doesn't take a lot of energy to cause it to spread, so it may be stiff but it isn't tough.
A fuller explanation of this took material scientists and engineers a long time to work out would require a whole book to do it justice. Luckily that book has been written and is called The New Science of Strong Materials. It is well worth a read."
Why does potassium react more violently with water than lithium?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95509/why-does-potassium-react-more-violently-with-water-than-lithium,19k,"For the reaction,
$$\ce{M -> M+ + e-}$$  
the heat liberated is highest for lithium owing to its high negative $E^\circ$ value so one would think that the reaction must be most vigorous.   
The reason behind the more violent reactivity of potassium rather than lithium lies in kinetics and not in thermodynamics. 
No doubt, maximum energy is evolved with lithium but the vaporization and ionization will also consume maximum energy (the melting point and ionization energy of lithium are the highest) and so the reaction proceeds gently. On the other hand, potassium has a lower melting point and ionization enthalpy. The heat of reaction is sufficient to melt it. The molten metal spreads over the water and exposes a larger surface to water. Also, the hydrated radius of lithium is the greatest out of all alkali metals. This reduces the ionic mobility which in turn reduces the speed of the molten metal.  
That's why potassium gives a more violent reaction with water.

Why is the bond angle H-P-H smaller than H-N-H?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14087/why-is-the-bond-angle-h-p-h-smaller-than-h-n-h,33k,"Starting point: 2s orbitals are lower in energy than 2p orbitals.
The $\ce{H-N-H}$ bond angle in ammonia is around 107 degrees.  Therefore, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is roughly $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized and the 4 orbitals emanating from nitrogen (the orbitals used for the 3 bonds to hydrogen and for the lone pair of electrons to reside in) point generally towards the corners of a tetrahedron.  
In the analogous case for phosphorus (phosphine, $\ce{PH_3}$), the $\ce{H-P-H}$ bond angle is 93.5 degrees.  This angle indicates that the phosphorus atom is almost unhybridized (the bond angle would be 90 degrees if it were completely unhybridized). The 3 bonds from phosphorus to hydrogen roughly involve the three 3p orbitals on phosphorus and the phosphorus lone pair of electrons resides in the 3s orbital of phosphorus.
So the question becomes, why does the nitrogen atom in ammonia choose to hybridize, while the phosphorus atom in phosphine does not? Let's start by listing the factors that will stabilize or destabilize geometries in these compounds.
There are two choices for the central atom:
remain unhybridized: [$\ce{p}$ orbital - H1s] bonds will form and they will be arranged 90 degrees with respect to one another.  As a result, 

substituents will be arranged closer together and destabilizing steric interactions will be increased
due to the absence of s-character in the $\ce{X-H}$ bonds emanating from $\ce{X}$, the electrons in these orbitals will be higher in energy
the lone pair electrons will be highly stabilized since they will reside in a low energy, pure s orbital

or
hybridize: [$\ce{sp^3}$ orbital - H1s] bonds will form and they will be arranged 109 degrees with respect to one another.  As a result, 

steric interactions will be reduced because the tetrahedral orbital arrangement will space the attached substituents further apart
due to the presence of s-character in the $\ce{X-H}$ bonds emanating from $\ce{X}$, the electrons in these orbitals will be lower in energy
the lone pair electrons will be less stabilized since they will reside in a higher energy orbital that contains significant p-character

An example:
Let's now consider the example of $\ce{NH_3}$ and $\ce{NF_3}$.  Fluorine is much more electronegative than hydrogen, therefore we would expect electron density in the $\ce{N-F}$ bond to be shifted away from nitrogen towards fluorine.  Because of this electron redistribution, the $\ce{sp^3}$ orbital on nitrogen involved in this bond will contain less electron density.  Consequently it will rehybridize - if there is less electron density in the orbital, there is less of a need for lower energy, electron stabilizing s-character in this orbital.  The orbital will wind up with higher p-character and the s-character that has been ""saved"" can be used to stabilize other electrons (the lone pair!).  Our prediction would be that $\ce{NF_3}$ should have more p-character in its $\ce{N-F}$ bonds than $\ce{NH_3}$ has in its $\ce{N-H}$ bonds.  As a result we would expect the $\ce{F-N-F}$ bond angle in $\ce{NF_3}$ to be smaller than the $\ce{H-N-H}$ bond angle in $\ce{NH_3}$.  Indeed the bond angle in $\ce{NF_3}$ is 102 degrees compared to the 107 degrees observed in ammonia!
Back to our problem:
Nitrogen (3.04) is more electronegative than phosphorus (2.19), which is about the same as hydrogen(2.2).  In our $\ce{X-H}$ bonds, we would therefore expect more electron density around the central atom when $\ce{X~=~N}$ than when $\ce{X~=~P}$.  Using the same reasoning used in our example, we would then expect the $\ce{N-H}$ bonds in ammonia to have higher s-character (and a larger $\ce{H-N-H}$ angle) than the analogous bonds in phosphine, just as observed.  The fact that phosphorus, being a second row element, has longer $\ce{P-H}$ bonds (142 pm) than ammonia (102 pm) lessens steric problems in the unhybridized geometry and further lowers the energy of the unhybridized configuration for phosphine.
In the case of ammonia, the shorter $\ce{N-H}$ bond lengths (increased steric interactions) and the increased electron density in the $\ce{N-H}$ bonds makes the  hybridized case the lowest energy.  Whereas in the case of phosphine, steric interactions are of less consequence because of the longer bond lengths and the decreased electron density in the bonds around phosphorus make the energetics of the (nearly) unhybridized geometry more favorable."
Is methanol more acidic than water?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/42535/is-methanol-more-acidic-than-water,34k,"The relative acidities of these molecules in the aqueous solution$^{[1][2]}$ is:
$$\text{methanol > water > ethanol > isopropanol > t-butanol}$$
The relative acidities of these molecules in DMSO$^{[3]}$ is:
$$\text{methanol > ethanol > isopropanol > water > t-butanol}$$
The problem with only considering the acidities of these molecules in an aqueous solution is that it assumes only one explanation for acidity. The inversion of the order of acidity in DMSO indicates that there are multiple factors at play.
The acidity trend in DMSO is explained by polarizability and the anionic hyperconjugation effect$^{[4]}$ of the conjugate bases of the molecules. The larger size of the alkyl substituents in the conjugate bases allows for increased distribution of negative charge over a larger volume. This reduces the charge density, and thereby the Coulombic repulsion between the conjugate base and the solvent. In DMSO, water is much less acidic than even methanol, which is also consistent with the relative polarizability of a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, but fails to explain the relative acidity of t-butanol and methanol.
The trend in alcohol acidity is explained by anionic hyperconjugation, which is weakened in larger alkyl substituents.

For methanol and the methoxide anion, the primary interaction occurs between a filled lone-pair ($n$) orbital on oxygen and an unoccupied $\pi^*_\ce{Me}$ orbital of the methyl group, resulting in a two-electron stabilizing effect.


$\hspace{3.8cm}$


Deprotonation of the alcohol leads to an increase in the energy of the n orbitals on oxygen, and a decreased energy separation between the interacting orbitals $n$ and $\pi^*_\ce{Me}$, and hence a greater stabilizing interaction$^{[5]}$.

Although DMSO does solvate the solute to an extent, because is an aprotic solvent, it is incapable of hydrogen bonding with the solute. This allows DMSO acidities better reflect the intrinsic acidities of the molecules.
In aqueous solution, however, the conjugate bases are stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Because smaller ions are better solvated by water, water's acidity is increased more than methanol's, but because methanol is intrinsically more acidic due to its polarizability, it is still slightly more acidic than water, even in an aqueous solution. As the size of the alkyl substituent increases, the alcohol becomes weaker due to the decreasing ability of water to solvate the conjugate base. This has a greater effect on the alcohol's acidity than the dispersion of the negative charge, and overrides the intrinsic acidity, inverting the order of acidity.

How does ammonium nitrate explode on its own?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/138440/how-does-ammonium-nitrate-explode-on-its-own,12k,"It is known that ammonium nitrate decompose exothermically when heated to form nitrous oxide and water. This paper1 notes that the irreversible decomposition of ammonium nitrate occurs at the temperature range of $\pu{230-260 ^\circ C}$.
$$\ce{NH4NO3 ->[t >230 ^\circ C] N2O + 2H2O}$$
They also further noted that beyond $\pu{280 ^\circ C}$, $\ce{NH4NO3}$ is  capable of rapid, self-accelerating decomposition (to the point of detonation).
But at the detonation temperature, $\mathrm{t_d}$ (the temperature at which compounds detonate), ammonium nitrate fully decomposes to nitrogen, oxygen and water releasing a tremendous amount of energy.
$$\ce{2NH4NO3 ->[t_d] 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O}$$
In the context of Beirut explosion, the question that raised was ""when did ammonium nitrate reached detonation temperature, and why did it suddenly explode?"". According to a news report from cnet.com:

When heated to above 170 degrees Fahrenheit, ammonium nitrate begins
to undergo decomposition. But with rapid heating or detonation, a
chemical reaction can occur that converts ammonium nitrate to nitrogen
and oxygen gas and water vapor. The products of the reaction are
harmless -- they're found in our atmosphere -- but the process
releases huge amounts of energy.[...]
Additionally, in the explosion, not all of the ammonium nitrate is
used up and exploded. Some of it decomposes slowly creating toxic
gases like nitrogen oxides. It's these gases that are responsible for
the red-brown plume of smoke seen in the aftermath of the Beirut
explosion, Rae said.

So, my theory is that ammonium nitrate started heating (from the fire) releasing all sorts of nitrogen oxides (the red fumes). This fire further accelerated the reaction, further heating the remaining ammonium nitrate to the point of detonation and that's when ammonium nitrate exploded instantaneously releasing tremendous amount of energy which send shockwaves around the site along with a white mushroom shaped cloud (from @DDuck's comment) which could probably be nitrogen and/or water vapours where the humid air (water vapor laden air) condensed due to the explosion(@StianYttervik) with release of nitrogen. It is a sad and quite devastating incident.

The interesting story is that the initial results by ion-selective electrode was that Mars soil is full of nitrates. Nobody knew on Earth that the nitrate ion selective electrode is far more responsive to perchlorate than nitrate. After learning this, it was an eye opener for analytical chemists! Now they wish to use chromatography rather than electrochemistry. So this was a good lesson for us on Earth.
The perchlorate ion was discovered in 2008 by the nitrate selective electrode. No specific electrode was attached to detect perchlorate, it was rather an accidental discovery. The Science Report makes a footnote ""Detection of Perchlorate and the Soluble Chemistry of Martian Soil at the Phoenix Lander Site"" (paper: Science 2009, 325 (5936), 64–67)
A Hofmeister anion ISE was intended to monitor nitrate from a $\ce{LiNO3}$ reference electrolyte that was part of the leaching solution, but was ultimately used for perchlorate detection

[Footnote] The relative sensitivity of the Hofmeister series ISE to perchlorate
  over nitrate is 1000:1, and substantial quantities of perchlorate will
  overwhelm any other signal. If, as was observed, >1 mM perchlorate
  accounts for the observed signal, it would require >1000 mM nitrate to
  produce the same response. This would correspond to more than the mass
  of the entire sample.

Now that they know it is a perchlorate ion, people did some studies on supercooled brines. See this paper: Toner, J.; Catling, D.; Light, B. The formation of supercooled brines, viscous liquids, and low-temperature perchlorate glasses in aqueous solutions relevant to Mars. Icarus 2014, 233, 36–47 (also available here). They clearly show that if calcium or magnesium perchlorates are slowly cooled, one can get supercooled brines up to -120 Celcius. This is a rather amazing finding. They call it a glassy state."
Choosing the right condenser,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/608/choosing-the-right-condenser,77k,"@Mart 's comment impelled me to return to this question and correct my answer. I've deleted incorrect material and expanded the discussion to, hopefully, provide correct information. There is a good discussion (better than the reference previously cited) of the issue here.  

Reflux is the process of boiling reactants while continually cooling the vapor returning it back to the flask as a liquid. It is used to heat a mixture for extended periods and at certain temperatures...A condenser is attached to the boiling flask, and cooling water is circulated to condense escaping vapors. 

If you are refluxing a mixture, as you might in organic synthesis to increase the speed of the reaction by doing it at a higher temperature (i.e., the boiling point of the solvent), then any of the condensers that worked well enough to avoid the loss of solvent and avoid ""flooding"" would work equally well. When you're refluxing, you want the ""reflux ring"", the place where the vapor is visibly condensing into a liquid, to be no more than 1/3 of the way up the reflux column.
You have two different basic types of condensers shown, Graham-type condensers (the first 3) and coil condensers (the last two). In the coil condensers (the left condenser in the picture below), the water flows through the coil and the vapor moves up in the larger, outside  area of the condenser, condenses onto the cooled coils, then drips back into the pot. In a Graham-type condenser (the right condenser in the picture below), the water flows around a tube (whether straight or coiled) that contains the vapor/condensed liquid.(picture source) The Graham-type condensers clog (or flood) more easily since they have a more restricted path for the liquid to return to the pot. 
 
Graham-type condensers: The Liebig condenser is simple, but has low cooling capacity and can be fairly easily clogged as the condensed liquid flows back into the flask and blocks the vapor that is trying to escape. The Allihn improves on this design by having a wider bore at the bottom and condensing the liquid on the ""bubbles"" where it can run down the sides and avoid blocking the vapor. (I've used this to good effect in refluxing many reactions.) The Graham condenser is the same basic design as the other two, but the condensation tube is coiled which provides more surface area for cooling...but also tends to send the condensed liquid right into the path of the vapor trying to move up. It is particularly prone to flooding. 
Coil condensers, such as the Dimroth and Freidrichs, have high capacity for cooling with fewer problems from flooding since the vapor condenses on the coils and drips back from the little prominence at the bottom of the coils into the center of the pot. The vapor has an easy time getting past the drops falling into the pot. If you can afford it, this seems like a good choice for most applications. The Freidrichs condensers, which incorporate a cold-finger with the spiral, are higher capacity, quite bulky and heavy. I have seen them used with rotovaps where you are taking a lot of solvent off quickly, but not with an ordinary reflux apparatus. This would be over-kill for a simple reflux reaction situation.
Sorry for the incorrect information (for those of you who looked at this before) and hope this is helpful."

Why is gold unreactive when only one electron is in the outer shell?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/21810/why-is-gold-unreactive-when-only-one-electron-is-in-the-outer-shell,52k,"First off, gold does react. You can form stable gold alloys and gold compounds. It's just hard, mostly for reasons explained by the other answer
The reason bulk gold solid is largely unreactive is because the electrons in gold fall at energies which few molecules or chemicals match (i.e., due to relativistic effects).
A nice summary of some work by Jens K. Norskov can be found here:
http://www.thefreelibrary.com/What+makes+gold+such+a+noble+metal%3F-a017352490

In their experiments, they distinguished between gold atoms' ability to break and form bonds and the ease with which they form new compounds, such as gold oxides. The two qualities are related: To make a compound, gold atoms must bond with other atoms, yet they cannot do so until they have sundered their bonds with neighboring gold atoms. 

I think this is a nice succinct explanation. You always have this trade-off in reactions, but in gold, you don't get much energy in the new compound formation, and you're losing the gold-gold interactions.
You can, of course, react gold with aggressive reagents like aqua regia, a 3:1 mix of $\ce{HCl}$ and $\ce{HNO3}$.
If properly done, the product is $\ce{HAuCl4}$ or chloroauric acid."
"""Middle row anomaly"" of the periodic table",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/31113/middle-row-anomaly-of-the-periodic-table,11k,"This is due to the transition metal contraction. 
Bromine has the electron configuration $\ce{[Ar] 4s^{2} 3d^{10} 4p^{5}}. $The 3d orbital has no radial nodes and is therefore quite contracted (close to the nucleus), so there is relatively little repulsion between the 3d electrons and the 4p electrons. This makes it much harder to acheive high oxidation states of bromine (I, IV, VI for the examples you give) because the ionization energies are higher than you might expect from a simplistic approach to periodic trends."
Why do we use helium in balloons?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/16055/why-do-we-use-helium-in-balloons,69k,"As other answers have noted, the only gas lighter than helium is hydrogen, which has some flammability issues that make it more difficult to handle safely than helium.
Also, in practice, hydrogen is not significantly ""lighter"" than helium.  While the molecular mass (and thus, per the ideal gas law, the density) of hydrogen gas is about half that of helium, what determines the buoyancy of a balloon is the difference between the density of the gas inside the balloon and the air outside.
The density of air at STP is about $\rho_{\ce{air}}=\pu{1.2754 kg m-3}$ , while the densities of hydrogen and helium gas are $\rho_{\ce{H2}}=\pu{0.08988 kg m-3}$ and $\rho_{\ce{He}}=\pu{0.1786 kg m-3}$  respectively.  The buoyant forces of a hydrogen balloon and a helium balloon in air (neglecting the weight of the skin and the pressure difference between the inside and the outside, which both decrease the buoyancy somewhat) are proportional to the density differences  $\rho_{\ce{air}} -\rho_{\ce{H2}}=\pu{1.1855 kg m-3}$  and $\rho_{\ce{air}} -\rho_{\ce{He}}=\pu{1.0968 kg m-3}$.  Thus, helium is only about $7.5\%$ less buoyant in air than hydrogen.
Of course, if the surrounding air were replaced with a lighter gas, the density difference between hydrogen and helium would become more significant.  For example, if you wished to go ballooning on Jupiter, which has an atmosphere consisting mostly of hydrogen and some helium, a helium balloon would simply sink, and even a pure hydrogen balloon (at ambient temperature) would not lift much weight.  Of course, you could always just fill the balloon with ambient Jovian air and heat it up to produce a hot hydrogen balloon (not to be confused with a Rozière balloon, which are used on Earth and have separate chambers for hot air and hydrogen / helium).

Ps. A quick way to approximately obtain this result is to note that a hydrogen molecule consists of two protons (and some electrons, which have negligible mass), and thus has a molecular mass of about $\pu{2 Da}$, while a helium atom has two protons and two neutrons, for a total mass of about $\pu{4 Da}$.
Air, meanwhile, is mostly oxygen and nitrogen: oxygen has a molecular mass of about  $\pu{32 Da}$ (8 protons + 8 neutrons per atom, two atoms per molecule), while nitrogen is close to  $\pu{28 Da}$ (one proton and one neutron per atom less than oxygen).  Thus, the average molecular mass of air should be between $28$ and  $\pu{32 Da}$; in fact, since air is about three quarters nitrogen, it's about  $\pu{29 Da}$, and so the buoyancies of hydrogen and helium in air are proportional to $29 - 2 = 27$ and $29 - 4 = 25$ respectively.  Thus, hydrogen should be about $\frac{(27 - 25)}{25} = \frac{2}{25} = \frac{8}{100} = 8\%$ more buoyant than helium, or, in other words, helium should be about $\frac{2}{27} \approx 7.5\%$ less buoyant than hydrogen.

Pps. To summarize some of the comments below, there are other possible lifting gases as well, but none of them appear to be particularly viable competitors for helium, at least not at today's helium prices.
For example, methane (molecular mass  $\approx \pu{16 Da}$) has about half the buoyancy of hydrogen or helium in the Earth's atmosphere, and is cheap and easily available from natural gas.  However, like hydrogen, it's also flammable, and while it's somewhat less dangerous by some measures (burn speed and flammability range), it's more dangerous by others (total energy content per volume).  In any case, the reduced buoyancy, together with the flammability, is probably enough to sink (pun not intended) methane as a viable alternative to helium.
A much less flammable choice would be water vapor which, with a molecular mass of  $\approx \pu{18 Da}$, is only slightly less buoyant than methane at the same temperature and pressure.  The obvious problem with water is that it's a liquid at ambient temperatures, which means it has to be heated to make it lift anything at all.  This wouldn't be so bad (after all, you get extra lift from the expansion due to heat), except for the fact that it makes any failure in the heating system a potential disaster — whereas a hot air balloon will just gently drift down if the burner fails, a hot steam balloon can experience catastrophic buoyancy loss if the vapor condenses.
Despite these drawbacks, hot steam balloons have certainly been suggested, studied and tried in the past — alas, not always particularly successfully (although, apparently, there have been much more successful attempts as well).  There are various ways in which the condensation issue could potentially be reduced, such as adding extra insulation layers to the balloon envelope, or even surrounding the steam balloon with a more conventional hot air envelope.  So far, however, it seems that steam balloons remain firmly in the realm of nifty but impractical ideas.
Other potential lifting gases, with molecular mass similar to methane and water, include ammonia and neon.  Neon, being a noble gas like helium, would certainly work and be safe, but alas, it's both less buoyant and more expensive than helium.
Ammonia, on the other hand, while much less flammable than methane, is rather toxic and corrosive (not to mention really stinky, which, given its other properties, is probably a good thing).  I don't think I'd like to fly in an ammonia balloon, but apparently, some people do!  It seems that its main advantage (besides being much cheaper than helium) is its relatively low vapor pressure, which makes it easier to store and handle in compressed form.
Thus, at least for some niche applications (mainly hobbyists and some weather balloons, AFAICT), ammonia might actually be the most viable alternative to helium (and hot air) today, with methane / natural gas perhaps coming second.  If helium were to become more scarce and expensive, these low-cost lifting gases (and possibly other alternatives, like helium recovery or even steam balloons) might become more practical.  Then again, so would hydrogen — its safety issues, though well known, are not insurmountable, especially not for things like unmanned weather balloons where the risks are much less.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀"

Gibbs free energy-minimum or zero?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/4/gibbs-free-energy-minimum-or-zero,30k,"I think your question really arises from some confusion about what $\Delta G$ represents. In general, $\Delta X$ for a thermodynamic quantity $X$ is the change of $X$ along some process. You could make it clear by actually writing $\Delta G(\text{A}\rightarrow\text{B})$ where A and B are before and after states. (We'll note that, in the general case, $\Delta X$ depends on the path take from A to B, making this notation improper. If $X$ is a function of state, though, you're good to go.)
However, in the equation you quote:
$$\Delta G = \Delta G^0 + RT \ln Q$$
the $\Delta G$ is a free energy of reaction and should thus be denoted $\Delta_\mathrm r G$, with the correct equation being:
$$\Delta_\mathrm r G = \Delta_\mathrm r G^0 + RT \ln Q$$
The free energy of reaction is defined as $\Delta_\mathrm r G = G_{\text{products}} - G_{\text{reactants}}$.

Thus, this $\Delta_\mathrm r G$ is not the variation of $G$ over the entire reaction, which would be the $\Delta G$ of the system between the start of the reaction and the equilibrium.

Why does basicity of group 15 hydrides decrease down the group?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/16215/why-does-basicity-of-group-15-hydrides-decrease-down-the-group,45k,"Each of these molecules has a pair of electrons in an orbital - this is termed a ""lone pair"" of electrons.  It is the lone pair of electrons that makes these molecules nucleophilic or basic.  As you move down the column from nitrogen to bismuth, you are placing your outermost shell of electrons, including the lone pair, in a larger and more diffuse orbital (the nitrogen lone pair is contained in the n=2 shell, while the bismuth lone pair is in the n=6 shell).  As the electron density of the lone pair is spread over a greater volume and is consequently more diffuse, the lone pair of electrons becomes less nucleophilic, less basic.
Commment: But greater the EN of the central atom , lesser would be its tendency to donate electrons right?
Response to Comment: The ENs of the central atoms are N (3.04), P (2.19), As (2.18), Sb (2.05), Bi (2.02). All of these atoms, except for nitrogen have similar ENs and I think the electron density argument is valid for them. However, in the case of nitrogen and phosphorous there is a significant EN difference that would tend to argue in the direction opposite to my answer. However there is another important difference between N and P. The lone pair in ammonia is in an sp3 orbital. In all of the other cases the central atom is essentially unhybridized (~90° H-X-H angles) and the lone pair exists in an s orbital. Therefore the lone pair electron density in ammonia (being in an sp3 orbital) is effectively increased compared to phosphine where the lone pair is in an s orbital. So even though the EN difference between N and P is significant, when hybridization differences of the central atom are taken into account the electron density argument still explains the trend in basicity."
Why is pyrimidine less basic than pyridine?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/50303/why-is-pyrimidine-less-basic-than-pyridine,21k,"It is not the number of lone pairs that in any way explains basicity. Take a random sugar and it will have ten times the number of lone pairs (albeit on oxygen, not on nitrogen) without being significantly basic.
The problem is electronics. Nitrogen, being a rather electronegative atom, is able to draw the π electrons towards it well — to the extent that pyridine derivatives are termed extremely electron poor and thus very slow in electrophilic substitution reactions.
Going from pyridine to pyrimidine we need to double that. Thus, there is a perceived severe shortage of electrons in that ring since both nitrogens are trying to draw them towards themselves.
Now assume you protonate that species. We now have two nitrogens of which one is positively charged. Immediately, that positively charged nitrogen multiplies its electron-withdrawing force. Equally immediately, the other nitrogen feels electron density leaving its vicinity. The whole system is much less favourable than the pyridine system with only a single nitrogen.
Rephrasing that argument: Basicity is increased when electron-donating neighbours increase the electron density (that equals a partial negative charge) on an atom. In pyrimidine’s case, we have an electron-withdrawing neighbour that reduces the electron density (giving a partial positive charge) and making protonation (i.e. more positive charge) less favourable."
What is a non-classical carbocation?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/31732/what-is-a-non-classical-carbocation,50k,"Here is a picture of a ""classical"" carbocation, there is an electron deficient carbon bearing a positive charge.

There are many examples of ""non-classical"" carbocations, but the 2-norbornyl carbocation is among the best known.

Labeling experiments have shown that the positive charge resides on more than one carbon in the 2-norbornyl ion.  Early on, the data was explained by equilibrating classical ions, but soon another possibility emerged - one involving a single non-classical ion.
The problem comes down to: are the equilibrating classical ions ground state structures with the non-classical ion serving as the transition state, or is the non-classical ion the ground state? This debate went on for a very long period of time, but now most agree that the non-classical structure is the ground state in the 2-norbornyl system.  In fact, a recent, and difficult to obtain, crystal structure for the 2-norbornyl cation has been published proving that the ion exists with the non-classical geometry (thanks to Klaus for finding this reference, see his comment below). 

A key difference between classical and non-classical structures is the bonding.  As illustrated above, a classical ion has a carbon with a sextet of electrons and 3 other bonds.  The non-classical ion, on the other hand, involves 3 carbons with 2 electrons spread over them.  This is called a 3-center 2-electron bond (hypercoordinate bonding) and is a clear marker for a non-classical ion.  Notice if you count all of the bonds to any of these 3 carbon atoms (solid and dashed lines) you count 5!  Sounds strange, but such ""hypercoordinate bonding"" is a permitted consequence of the 3-center 2-electron bond.

Here is a link to a simpler non-classical carbocation discussed here yesterday."

"IUPAC nomenclature: ""Smallest sum of locants""?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/27095/iupac-nomenclature-smallest-sum-of-locants,32k,"The guideline that you have mentioned (‘While naming any compound, the numbering should be done such that position of substituted groups gives the smallest sum.’) does not exist in the IUPAC recommendations.
The corresponding section in the current version of Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry – IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013 (Blue Book) actually reads as follows:

P-14.3.5 Lowest set of locants


The lowest set of locants is defined as the set that, when compared term by term with other locant sets, each cited in order of increasing value, has the lowest term at the first point of difference; for example, the locant set ‘2,3,5,8’ is lower than ‘3,4,6,8’ and ‘2,4,5,7’.
(…)

Therefore, the smallest sum of locants can lead to wrong results.
For example, for 2,7,8-trimethyldecane, the smallest sum of locants would yield the wrong name ‘3,4,9-trimethyldecane’, since $2+7+8=17 > 3+4+9=16$.

Likewise, for 2,2,6,6,7-pentamethyloctane, the smallest sum of locants would yield the wrong name ‘2,3,3,7,7-pentamethyloctane’, since $2 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 23 > 2 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 7 = 22$.

For 1,6,7-trimethylnaphthalene, the smallest sum of locants would yield the wrong name ‘2,3,5-trimethylnaphthalene’, since $1 + 6 + 7 = 14 > 2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.

For 1,6-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, the smallest sum of locants would yield the wrong name ‘2,3-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene’, since $1 + 6 = 7 > 2 + 3 = 5$.

Anyway, the IUPAC recommendations have more than 1500 pages. Hence, you should be careful when applying any simplified or abridged version of the nomenclature rules."
Generating neat orbitals/surfaces from molden/wfn-files,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33932/generating-neat-orbitals-surfaces-from-molden-wfn-files,15k,"Often different quantum chemical programs require different analysing tools. Unfortunately there is no universal standard (program), that can do it all. If there were, someone would come along and just invent something new.

I personally prefer ChemCraft for producing publication ready images. It is a commercially distributed program. It mainly supports any Gaussian and GAMESS file formats (and Firefly by extension). It can visualize quite a few more formats now. What I especially like about the program is that it can read the files generated by the NBO programs. It makes visualisation of all kinds of localised and canonical orbitals much simpler.
There are some more features of the program I really got attached to, like symmetrizing molecules or building molecules from scratch. It has the big advantage of writing the symmetry adapted data group for GAMESS for custom basis sets, which I have not been able to find anywhere else. But this is certainly not the target of this post.
 Unfortunately it is not able to read molden or wfn[1] files.  
The program comes with a large number of visualisation schemes, which can easily be modified to produce a personalised style. Below is a small demonstration.

Most of the times I would use one of the above, depending on whom I have to impress. Often it is far more beneficial to have monochrome images, like the ones below.

A quite recent addition came with styles that allow you to generate simple 2D like structure. It is still possible to overlay these structures with orbital plots. (Unfortunately the transparency is hard-coded and cannot be set explicitly.)

The caveat is obviously, that it cannot read molden or wfn[1] files, not even Turbomole output.
A feature that I am still missing is the batch production of orbital pictures. You still always have to save them by hand, which can be incredibly tedious for large molecules (and large active spaces). (But I have written a feature request for that.)
Support for the program is quite good and the available help files are even helpful. Most of the features can be understood intuitively, however, as always, it takes time to get used to working with it.
Another caveat is, that the windows version outperforms its little linux brother by a lot. If you already run windows somewhere, that is probably fine for you. If you run linux almost everywhere, then you have to deal with some missing features (or recently it can be ported via wine, making it slow though).

I do use molden (Xwindow) quite a lot for intermediate visualisation, since it is one of the fastest interfaces available. It is very robust and has low graphics; you can easily use it whit a rather slow internet connection. It is free for private and non-commercial usage. Since my first days as a computational chemist involved the use of 56k-modem for checkup routines, this was one of the only go to programs. It will always be the first program I install on a work-dedicated computer. One simply does not forget his or her oldest friend.
A very big plus is the very well structured and written postscript files produced by molden. Some of the purists might even like it. Here are a few converted samples, but you can download the source here (via tinyupload.com).

Such files can become extremely handy, when preparing posters (especially when using LaTeX). I have on occasion seen molecular plots generated by molden in publications; I am even guilty of that. However, nowadays I believe there are more elegant methods.

Visualising Turbomole output has been, is and will probably always be a painful experience. For some of the deeper features you should probably be an expert in gnuplot, too. For the basics of structure and orbitals, the current recommendation is to use TmoleX, the GUI to turbomole. If it is done by the same people who designed define, then it's will be quite painfully to use. When I was a heavy user of turbomole, this did not exist, so I should probably shut up.
Judging from the current (version 7.0) manual the workflow I used is still somewhat recommended. It is to let the native modules create the binary *.plt files, which are gOpenMol input. Unfortunately, what was once a very aspiring program is nowadays not developed any more. You can still obtain an unsupported copy. The source code is available, but the current license state of the program is somewhat unclear. Since VMD (see Brians post) and TmoleX do now support gOpenMol files, the necessity of learning a deprecated program is probably not useful any more. One of the prime features of this program however was that it has a tcl interface and hence was fully scriptable - apparently something that VMD now also has.
It is well capable of producing nice orbital pictures, you might have seen them on this page already. (I tweaked the Gaussian output a bit, since I do not have Turbomole available.)

Although it supports quite a few file formats, molden input and wfn[1] is unsupported. 

[1] Let's come to the last part: wfn files. However you produce them, they are probably not up to date. The main (and probably only) purpose for those files is the analysis with AIMPAC -  a program that is no longer developed. They have one very big disadvantage: they cannot deal with functions higher than of f type. If you are using a triple zeta basis set, you probably have those functions. Another disadvantage is, that they don not include information about possible effective core potentials.
For the purpose of analysing the electron density with the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) the much superior version wfn extended (*.wfnx or *.wfx) should be used. I am currently only aware of Gaussian to create such files correctly. The main program which uses these files is AIMAll. It is also a commercially available program. You can learn more about these files on the specification page there.
The only valuable point of creating molecular orbitals with this program is, if you want to overlay it with the bond paths instead of just sticks. Just like in this example:

Apart from this usage, the process is very tiring and needs many steps to be completely performed. Working the program non-local is very, very slow. And to be perfectly honest, what is the purpose of the above other than impressing a few organic chemists?
Another negative aspect of the program is the very high demand of memory and storage, especially for large molecules.
In conclusion: If you are not doing QTAIM analysis you should probably refrain from *.wfx files for visualisation purposes. For every QC program there usually comes a workable interface/visualisation program. With any program there is the activation barrier of learning how to do things to overcome. In any case, I suggest having a few ready to work with, you never know where you go and you might have to learn a new program any time.
I think the biggest loss of any visualisation tool is the neglect of writing good tutorials or even a basic documentation."
"What exactly is hydrogen bonding (and does it really need fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen)?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5503/what-exactly-is-hydrogen-bonding-and-does-it-really-need-fluorine-oxygen-or-n,30k,"There are two main ways to look at hydrogen bonding.  The first is electrostatic, where the electronegativity of the atoms is used to describe the interaction.  Your argument about chlorine being more electronegative than nitrogen is a good one suggesting that the electrostatic argument is only part of the story, and there is at least one study that suggests that hydrogen bonding does occur with chlorine in polar molecules such as chloroform.
We can increase dramatically the number of atoms considered to undergo hydrogen bonding if we take a molecular orbital approach.  My reasoning here is a summary of what can be found in Inorganic Chemistry by Miessler, Fischer and Tarr.  They, in turn, rely heavily on a new definition of hydrogen bonding recommended by the IUPAC Physical and Biophysical Chemistry Division.
A hydrogen bond is formed when an $\ce{X-H}$ (where X is more electronegative than H) interacts with a donor atom, $\ce{B}$.  The attraction $\ce{X-H...B}$ can be described as consisting of the following components:

An electrostatic contribution based on the polarity of $\ce{X-H}$
A partial covalent character which arises from the donor-acceptor nature of the interaction
Dispersion forces

The first bullet is typically the only phenomenon discussed in General Chemistry classes, and this is not unreasonable since the second bullet requires the introduction of Lewis Acid/Base concepts which may not have been covered.
It is important to note that the new definition includes what I like to call ""the proof is in the pudding"" where the existence of hydrogen bonding requires experimental evidence, which can be found using a number of methods:

The $\ce{X-H...B}$ bond angle: a bond angle of 180 degrees indicates strong hydrogen bonding and would be accompanied by shord $\ce{H...B}$ bond distances.
A red shift in the IR frequency upon formation of $\ce{X-H...B}$
Hydrogen bonding results in deshielding of the H atom, which can be observed in NMR spectroscopy.
Thermodynamic studies should indicate that $\Delta G$ for the formation of $\ce{X-H...B}$ should be larger than the thermal energy of the system.

While electrostatics is the dominant contributor to hydrogen bonding, an analysis of frontier orbitals can also be insightful.  A thorough answer requires a fair amount of MO theory background, but for those interested, looking at the MO diagram of $\ce{FHF-}$ will be helpful.  In brief, the base ($\ce{F-}$ in this case) has a filled $p_z$ orbital that gains access to a delocalized orbital with lower energy, thus validating the formation of a strong hydrogen bond."
Why is [PdCl4]2- square planar whereas [NiCl4]2- is tetrahedral?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/40880/why-is-pdcl42-square-planar-whereas-nicl42-is-tetrahedral,80k,"The geometry of the complex changes going from $\ce{[NiCl4]^2-}$ to $\ce{[PdCl4]^2-}$. Clearly this cannot be due to any change in the ligand since it is the same in both cases. It is the other factor, the metal, that leads to the difference.
Consider the splitting of the $\mathrm{d}$ orbitals in a generic $\mathrm{d^8}$ complex. If it were to adopt a square planar geometry, the electrons will be stabilised (with respect to a tetrahedral complex) as they are placed in orbitals of lower energy. However, this comes at a cost: two of the electrons, which were originally unpaired, are now paired:
$\hspace{30 mm}$
(source: Wikipedia)
and on top of that, there are additional steric repulsions introduced by moving the ligands closer together. (This is, to some extent, a throwback to VSEPR theory, which simply says that the ligands would rather adopt a tetrahedral arrangement because of their mutual repulsion.)
We can label these two factors as $\Delta E$ (stabilisation derived from occupation of lower-energy orbitals) and $P + S$ (pairing energy + steric repulsions) respectively. One can see that:

If $\Delta E > P + S$, then the complex will be square planar;
If $\Delta E < P + S$, then the complex will be tetrahedral.

This is analogous to deciding whether an octahedral complex adopts a high- or low-spin configuration; where the crystal field splitting parameter $\Delta_\mathrm{O}$, also called $10~\mathrm{Dq}$ in older literature, plays the same role as $\Delta E$ does above. (However, unlike $\Delta_\mathrm{O}$, there is no simple graphical way to represent $\Delta E$ on a diagram since multiple orbitals are changed in energy.)
The two main factors that differentiate the Ni(II) complex from the Pd(II) complex are therefore:

The $\mathrm{4d}$ orbitals of $\ce{Pd^2+}$ are more radially diffuse (i.e. bigger) and therefore form stronger overlap with the orbitals on $\ce{Cl-}$, as compared to the $\mathrm{3d}$ orbitals of $\ce{Ni^2+}$. This leads to larger splitting of the $\mathrm{d}$ orbitals - or the relevant MOs (I'm too lazy to check their symmetry labels) - and hence a larger $\Delta E$.
Again because the $\mathrm{d}$ orbitals are more diffuse, the pairing energy $P$ is smaller in the palladium complex (it basically costs less energy to stuff them into the same orbital).

Together, these two factors ensure that practically all $\mathrm{4d}$ and $\mathrm{5d}$ $\mathrm{d^8}$ $\ce{ML4}$ complexes adopt a square planar geometry, even if the ligand is not a strong-field ligand. Other examples of such square planar complexes are $\ce{[PtCl4]^2-}$ and $\ce{[AuCl4]^-}$.
In fact, I am digressing here, but the same factors also cause the octahedral complexes to be almost invariably low-spin. For example, the $\mathrm{d^5}$ complex $\ce{[Fe(ox)3]^3-}$ has five unpaired electrons, indicating a high-spin configuration, $\mathrm{(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^2}$. However, $\ce{[Ru(ox)3]^3-}$ has one unpaired electron, which implies a low-spin configuration $\mathrm{(t_{2g})^5}$."

As you move down a column, there are more protons, but there are also more complete energy levels below the valence electrons.  These lower energy levels shield the valence electrons from the attractive effects of the atom's nucleus, so the atomic radius gets larger."
A glass of water with ice-cubes in it. Where's the water the coldest; at the top or bottom?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/76736/a-glass-of-water-with-ice-cubes-in-it-wheres-the-water-the-coldest-at-the-top,53k,"Interesting question!
A few things first:

As the ice melts, it cools the water around it.

Technically, the ice cube melts because the water cools down. This may sound ridiculous at first, but you must consider the fact that the ice melts because it has drawn ""heat"" (energy) from its surroundings. The ""surroundings"" being the air and water that surround it (but the water's more important since it's a better conductor of thermal energy).

Given that cold water is denser than hot water, I would presume that the cold water would sink to the bottom...but it would warm as it sinks, reducing the density.

You're right, cold water is denser than hot water. It is helpful to note that it shouldn't be too cold though. As the temperature of water drops to 4 °C, the density of water gradually increases. However, as the temperature drops below 4 °C the density of water actually begins to decrease and water in this range easily ""floats"" over water in the room temperature range.


Meanwhile, the ice is still melting and giving off its cold to the surrounding water.

Ice isn't giving off its ""cold"", rather, it takes in the water's ""heat"" (thermal energy).

Back to your question.
As Max mentions in his answer, you have done a particularly good job of indicating what physical parameters we're dealing with; the really important ones being the temperature of ice, temperature of water (at the time you put the ice in) and the quantity of ice used (at least with respect to the water).
But assuming you're drinking water (originally at room temperature) out of a 250 ml styrofoam or plastic cup, and you used two (normal-sized) ice cubes and that you began drinking the water a minute after you plonk in the ice cubes, the water should be colder at the top than at the bottom.
Consider minute, imaginary layers/regions/packets of water in the cup (thinking about this in terms of water ""packets"" rather than water molecules is easier to comprehend). Also, think of the cup as having three (crudely demarcated) regions: Top, middle, and bottom.
Packets of water immediately adjacent to the ice cubes are in thermal equilibrium with the outermost regions of the ice. However, these packets soon gain some thermal energy from other water packets that are adjacent to them. So as these packets slowly rise in temperature, from zero degrees to past 4 °C, they sink and new packets occupy locations adjacent to the ice. The cycle repeats for as long as the ice is there.
Now, as those packets of ice sink, they gain more thermal energy from the packets of water they come in contact with on their way down. This, coupled with the viscous effects of water results in the mild ""warming up"" of the sinking packets.
Now since they warm up a bit, they tend to rise back up. Back at the top, they're get cooled and sink again. This process repeats for as long as the ice remains in the water.
Take a step back, and you'll see that the middle of the cup ought to be cold, the bottom of the cup ought to be colder, and the top of the cup is the coldest.
So even if the ice cubes aren't actually touching your lips, you'll find sipping the water at the top to be colder than sucking out water from the bottom through a straw."
Why super glue does not stick inside their own bottle?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32784/why-super-glue-does-not-stick-inside-their-own-bottle,34k,"From explainthatstuff.com:

Why doesn't glue stick to the tube?
Adhesives are designed to work when they leave the tube—and not
  before. Different adhesives achieve this in different ways. Some are
  dissolved in chemicals called solvents that keep them stable and
  non-sticky in the tube.
When you squeeze them out, the solvents
  quickly evaporate in the air or get absorbed by the surfaces you're
  sticking to, freeing the adhesives themselves to do their job.
Plastic modeling glue works like this. It contains molecules of
  polystyrene in
  an acetone solvent. When you squeeze the tube, the glue spurts out and
  you can usually smell the very strong acetone as it evaporates.
Once it's gone, the polystyrene molecules lock together to make strong
  chemical bonds.
  Glue doesn't smell when it's dry because all the
  solvent has vanished into the air.
Some glues (such as synthetic,
  epoxy resins) have to be mixed together before they work. They come in
  two different tubes, one containing the synthetic resin and the other
  containing a chemical that makes the resin harden. The two chemicals
  are useless by themselves but, mixed together, form a tough, permanent
  adhesive.

From sciencefocus.com:

How super glue works

The main ingredient in super glue is a chemical called cyanoacrylate, an acrylic resin that forms a bond (cures) almost
  instantly;
The only trigger it requires are the hydroxide ions found in water;
Traces of water are found on almost everything and in the surrounding air, which causes the glue to become sticky;
It works best in moist conditions, although it is not advised to start gluing on a soaking wet surface.


Therefore the lack of water in the tube, or the chance of solvents evaporation, doesn't allow the glue to stick to the tube.
In other words: that strong smell that comes out when we open the tube's cap is due to the solvents evaporation, so once they're gone the glue sticks. If a superglue tube is left open for a long time (exposed to air, allowing the water to come in contact with the glue), it's impossible (or almost) to squeeze it out since it got stuck to the tube."
Is the ammonium substituent (-NH3+) really meta-directing in electrophilic substitution?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/31644/is-the-ammonium-substituent-nh3-really-meta-directing-in-electrophilic-subst,39k,"how is anilinium ion meta directing for electrophiles?

Actually, anilinium is not meta directing (I know it is often taught that way), but rather it inductively deactivates the entire aromatic ring. 
To explain the electrophilic substitution pattern observed with any aromatic system we must consider both resonance and inductive effects.
Resonance Effects: You are correct that you can't delocalize the positive charge on the anilinium nitrogen into the benzene ring through resonance.  As you point out, resonance structures with 5 bonds to nitrogen aren't allowed.  

Therefore resonance effects are not involved in explaining the reactivity of the anilinium ion towards electrophilic aromatic substitution.
Inductive Effects: Inductively we expect the anilinium nitrogen to strongly withdraw electron density from the ortho position since it is closest to the positively charged nitrogen, this makes the ortho position the most deactivated.  Inductive effects die off quickly with distance, so we would expect the meta position to also be deactivated, but less so than the ortho position.  Finally, we would still expect some deactivation at the distant para position, but slightly less than we saw at the meta position. Overall, in terms of reactivity we would expect para > meta > ortho, with the difference between para and meta being much smaller than the difference between meta and ortho due to the effect distance has on inductive electron withdrawal.
If we examine the nitration of aniline in strong acid ($\ce{HNO3}$, $\ce{H2SO4}$), under these conditions the strong acid will completely protonate the aniline and reaction will proceed through the anilinium ion.  We see that, as expected, there is very little ortho product and slightly more para product than meta product.  This is pretty much as we expected and is consistent with the electron withdrawing inductive effect of the positive anilinium nitrogen."
What is actually the difference between valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33879/what-is-actually-the-difference-between-valence-bond-theory-and-molecular-orbita,23k,"TL;DR
VB theory treats atomic orbitals (including hybridized orbitals) as providing a good mathematical/physical description of the true form of the molecular wavefunction. MO theory uses atomic orbitals (with Gaussian radial functions) as a tool of computational convenience in an effort to define a molecular wavefunction that in its final form often bears little resemblance to the original atomic orbitals, or to the VB theory description.

Long Version
The key difference between the VB and MO theories lies in their respective assumptions of the underlying mathematical/physical form of the electronic wavefunction.
VB theory holds tightly to the mathematical structure of atomic orbitals (AOs), assuming that the electronic structure of a molecular system is described adequately by retaining the atomic orbitals (possibly hybridized) from each constituent atom, and overlapping them to form the needed description of bonding.  VB calculations are computationally much more complex: the AO basis is generally non-orthogonal, and the linear algebra and other techniques required to cope with this non-orthogonality are much more involved.
More broadly, the need to invoke resonance (superposition of multiple valence-bond structures) and other concepts highlights that, in fact, often this adherence to atomic orbitals and their valence-bond overlaps is not adequate for a proper description, at least not without extensive use of methods analogous to the configuration interaction of MO theory.  VB theory does hold certain advantages, however—for example, I believe the AO basis does sometimes allow for a more direct linkage to fundamental chemical concepts such as hybridization and Lewis electon-pair theory. To note, Sason Shaik is one of the strongest modern proponents of the theory I know of—he describes some of these strengths and their applications in his recent retrospective article (doi:10.1016/j.comptc.2017.02.011).
MO theory, at its core, casts away most assumptions regarding the mathematical structure of the electronic wavefunction, as long as properties like indistinguishability and the Pauli exclusion principle remain satisfied.  Calculations within MO theory can use a wide variety of mathematical structures to try to represent the wavefunction, ranging from gridded numerical quadrature approaches (see here and here, and also orbital-free DFT) to Slater orbital computations to the Gaussian-orbital based calculations used most commonly today.
One potential point of confusion is that MO theory in its most common implementations makes direct use of atomic orbitals in composing the molecular wavefunction (see LCAO theory). The distinction to be made here is that instead of attributing significance to the atomic orbitals as an intrinsically good descriptor of electronic structure, they are used merely because they afford a convenient mathematical form for efficient computation, in trying to construct the MOs.  Particular advantages are obtained from the use of atomic orbitals constructed from Gaussian functions, since the product of two Gaussians is another Gaussian (even in multiple dimensions) and numerical integration of n-dimensional Gaussian functions is straightforward.
It should be noted that, for as much of an improved description it affords, MO theory still is an approximation. For a given system, the electronic wavefunction just IS the highly-abstract mathematical object that satisfies the appropriate Schrodinger equation.  MO theory is used extensively because it provides one of the most computationally tractable paths to getting in the neighborhood of the ""real answer.""
Practical Aspects of MO theory
The ""simplest version"" of MO theory for a time-independent system under the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation is the Hartree-Fock method, which provides a remarkably good description considering the significant simplification represented by its mean-field approximation of the electron-electron interactions.  Hartree-Fock is in general not good enough for computations at the level of chemical accuracy (~$1\mathrm{\ kcal/mol}$), however, and numerous methods have been developed to refine it: the most often used techniques are Moller-Plesset perturbation theory, configuration interaction, and coupled cluster.
In-Depth Reading on MO Theory
For a deep dive into the underlying mathematics of MO computations, it's hard to beat the classic Szabo & Ostlund. As a more readable, lighter-weight introduction to MO theory and its implementations, I would recommend Frank Jensen's Introduction to Computational Chemistry."

Is density functional theory an ab initio method?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33764/is-density-functional-theory-an-ab-initio-method,14k,"First note that the acronym DFA I used in my comment originates from Axel D. Becke paper on 50 year anniversary of DFT in chemistry:

Let us introduce the acronym DFA at this point for “density-functional
  approximation.” If you attend DFT meetings, you will know that Mel
  Levy often needs to remind us that DFT is exact. The failures we
  report at meetings and in papers are not failures of DFT, but failures
  of DFAs. Axel D. Becke, J. Chem. Phys., 2014, 140, 18A301.

So, there are in fact two questions which must be addressed: ""Is DFT ab initio?"" and ""Is DFA ab initio?"" And in both cases the answer depend on the actual way ab initio is defined.

If by ab initio one means a wave function based method that do not make any further approximations than HF and do not use any empirically fitted parameters, then clearly neither DFT nor DFA are ab initio methods since there is no wave function out there.
But if by ab initio one means a method developed ""from first principles"", i.e. on the basis of a physical theory only without any additional input, then 


DFT is ab initio;
DFA might or might not be ab initio (depending on the actual functional used).


Note that the usual scientific meaning of ab initio is in fact the second one; it just happened historically that in quantum chemistry the term ab initio was originally attached exclusively to Hartree–Fock based (i.e. wave function based) methods and then stuck with them. But the main point was to distinguish methods that are based solely on theory (termed ""ab initio"") and those that uses some empirically fitted parameters to simplify the treatment (termed ""semi-empirical""). But this distinction was done before DFT even appeared.
So, the demarcation line between ab initio and not ab initio was drawn before DFT entered the scene, so that non-wave-function-based methods were not even considered. Consequently, there is no sense to question ""Is DFT/DFA ab initio?"" with this definition of ab initio historically limited to wave-function-based methods only. Today I think it is better to use the term ab initio in quantum chemistry in its more usual and more general scientific sense rather then continue to give it some special meaning which it happens to have just for historical reasons.
And if we stick to the second definition of ab initio then, as I already said, DFT is ab initio since nothing is used to formulate it except for the same physical theory used to formulate HF and post-HF methods (quantum mechanics). DFT is developed from the quantum mechanical description without any additional input: basically, DFT just reformulates the conventional quantum mechanical wave function description of a many-electron system in terms of the electron density.
But the situation with DFA is indeed a bit more involved. From the same viewpoint a DFA method with a functional which uses some experimental data in its construction is not ab initio. So, yes, DFA with B3LYP would not qualify as ab initio, since its parameters were fitted to a set of some experimentally measure quantities. However, a DFA method with a functional which does not involve any experimental data (except the values of fundamental constants) can be considered as ab initio method. Say, a DFA using some LDA functional constructed from a homogeneous electron gas model, is ab initio. It is by no means an exact method since it is based on a physically very crude approximation, but so does HF from the family of the wave function based methods. And if the later is considered to be ab initio despite the crudeness of the underlying approximation, why can't the former be also considered ab initio?"

In fact, household natural gas often contains a bit of ethane, which may vary depending on the current demand for ethane as a feedstock.
In short: it burns just as well, but ethane has other important uses.
Propane has some use as a feedstock, but it is an attractive fuel because it is easily stored as a liquid without requiring huge pressures."
Effect of drinking ultra-pure water,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/30754/effect-of-drinking-ultra-pure-water,17k,"What would be the effect if someone were to drink ultra-pure, 18 M-ohm water? 

Not much, although if they drank many gallons of the water it could be a problem.

Would they immediately die? 

No.

Would they just need to pee more? 

Probably.  

Would $\ce{CO2}$ from the air (after the bottle is opened) and whatever's in saliva dissolve into the water making it much less pure before it gets into the important parts of their digestive tract? 

It would become orders of magnitude less pure as soon as it mixed with their saliva and then their gastric juices.  Same as regular water.

What would be the threshold for bad things to happen -- a teaspoon, a liter, 12 gallons in 10 minutes (at which point I assume regular water would kill you)? 

I don't think the effect would be that different from drinking regular water.  All over the internet there is this idea that super pure water is somehow too pure or dangerous, no good evidence or mechanism is ever presented.
Water is toxic primarily because it dilutes the sodium and potassium ions in your body, leading to Hyponatremia or possibly the far more dangerous Hypokalemia.  The normal level of $\ce{Na+}$ in blood plasma is about 135 millimolar (mM), and the normal level of $\ce{K+}$ is about 5 mM.  
A very rough approximation to understanding how toxic water can be would then be to compare the concentration difference of sodium (or potassium) between the ingested water and the blood.  A 25 micromolar -- i.e. 25 μM or 0.000025 molar solution of sodium hydroxide has a conductivity of about 6.7 microsiemens per cm, more than 100-fold higher than ""pure"" 18.2 megohm water (0.055 microsiemens per cm).  According to this rough difference-based model, the ability of the very dilute sodium ion solution to cause problems is proportional to (135 - 0.025) mM, and the ability of the ""pure"" water to cause problems is (135 - 0) mM.  For nearly biological or medical conditions of interest, 135 mM is not really different from 134.975 mM, and so ultra-pure water is not really more dangerous than everyday drinking water."

Splitting of multiplets in ¹H NMR spectra?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/69/splitting-of-multiplets-in-%c2%b9h-nmr-spectra,23k,"Which nuclei you should consider as neighboring atoms for the multiplet splitting depends on the size of the coupling constant. The coupling constant are usually named after the number of bonds between the coupling nuclei, so a coupling between two hydrogens that are three bonds apart from each other would be a $\mathrm{^3J_{HH}}$-coupling. In an alkyl chain like CH3CH2 the coupling between the CH2 and the CH3 hydrogens would be a $\mathrm{^3J}$-coupling that is about 7 Hz large. Couplings over more than three bonds are usually not observed, because they are smaller than the linewidth of the signals in your NMR spectrum. The exception to that you're likely to encounter are couplings along C=C double bonds, where you can even see $\mathrm{^4J}$-couplings or more.
So the simplified rule would be that couplings along three bonds are visible, couplings along more than three bonds are only visible when there is at least one C=C double bond along the way.
The concepts of chemical and magnetic equivalence are essential to understanding how different multiplicities arise. Chemical equivalence means there exists a symmetry operation that exchanges those nuclei. Magnetically equivalent nuclei additionally need to have identical couplings to all other spins in the molecule. Magnetically equivalent nuclei don't couple to each other.
In propane the hydrogens of both CH3 groups are three bonds away from the hydrogens of the CH2 group, so the coupling between those is visible in the NMR spectrum. The hydrogens of each CH3 group are magnetically equivalent, due to the fast rotation along the C–C bond, and the two CH3 groups should also be magnetically equivalant. So you have 6 magnetically equivalent hydrogens that couple to your CH2 hydrogens. The result of that is a splitting into a septet (7).
The OH-group is an interesting exception, as you would expect it to lead to a visible coupling on hydrogens connected to the same carbon, but you don't observe that under most conditions. The reason is that the OH is acidic enough that the hydrogen exchanges quickly with the solvent, so the hydrogen dissasociates and associates quickly. This happens too fast for NMR, so the other nuclei only see the average OH-hydrogen. This eliminates the coupling to the OH, and it is also the reason why the OH-signal is often very broad or even completely gone in NMR spectra."
Does O2 have a color in the gas phase,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15035/does-o2-have-a-color-in-the-gas-phase,12k,"Background
$\ce{O2}$ exists as a paramagnetic, triplet since the two electrons in its two (degenerate) HOMO orbitals are unpaired. There are 6 known phases of solid oxygen with color ranging from pale blue to red to black.  In the liquid phase it has a light blue color.  This color is due to light absorption by the ground state triplet according to the following equation
$$\ce{2 O2(^3\Sigma_{g}) ->C[{h\nu}]\   2 O2(^1\Delta_{g})}$$
This absorption requires light from the red region of the spectrum (~630 nm).  If red light is absorbed , then blue light is transmitted or reflected and this gives rise to the blue color associated with liquid oxygen.
Answer
Note that the light absorption requires 2 molecules of $\ce{O2}$ and a photon, a 3-body process. If we now consider the probability of this 3-body process occurring in the gas phase, we can see that, since a gas is much more dilute than a liquid, the probability for of these 3 items coming together at the same time will be much smaller.  Hence, the probability of photon absorption in the gas phase is much reduced.  To the human eye oxygen gas will appear colorless (at normal and reduced pressures).  However, if you place the gas in a cell and record its visible spectrum you will still be able to detect this absorption."

Acidity of substituted phenols,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/19205/acidity-of-substituted-phenols,59k,"I would appreciate learning whether such reasoning, for these two
  type of substituted phenols is plausible or whether furthermore
  solid arguments should be invoked.

Your reasoning seems generally well thought out.  You clearly have a good understanding of inductive effects and you mention resonance effects in the cresol series.  Structural effects don't play a role with these compounds, but let me mention them for completeness.  If we have a compound such as I with a carbonyl ortho to the hydroxyl substituent, then in addition to inductive (stabilizes the anion) and resonance (stabilizes the anion) effects, we should also consider hydrogen bonding; which, in this case, would stabilize the phenol making it less acidic.  On the other hand, in compound 2, the bulky t-butyl group would force the ester carbonyl to twist out of the plane of the benzene ring.  In II, the inductive effect of the carbonyl would still operate, but the resonance and hydrogen bonding effects on acidity would be diminished.


I would appreciate learning why the difference in acidity between
  2- and 4-chlorophenols is much more pronounced than the same
  difference between o- and p-cresols

This link discusses electrophilic aromatic substitution, where again both inductive and resonance effects need to be considered.  About two-thirds of the way down the page we see that chlorobenzene undergoes electrophilic nitration about 30 times slower than benzene, but is still ortho-para directing.  We also see that toluene reacts about 25 times faster than benzene and is also ortho-para directing.  From these and other examples, we learn that chlorine donates electrons weakly by resonance and withdraws electrons strongly through its inductive effect; and that a methyl group is a mild electron donor through resonance (hyperconjugation), while its inductive effect is also electron-donating, but is small.
Let's apply these concepts from electrophilic aromatic substitution to your two phenol series.  In the chlorophenols, we would expect the chloro substituent to influence the series primarily through a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect.  Indeed, as the chlorine moves closer to the hydroxyl substituent, the inductive electron withdrawal increases in power and the $\mathrm pK_\mathrm a$ increases dramatically.  On the other hand, in the methyl series we expect mild resonance (hyperconjugation) effects to dominate (even though the inductive effect is in the same direction), therefore in the ortho- and para-cresols we expect the anion to be weakly destabilized and consequently a bit less acidic than phenol itself; while the meta isomer, with minimal resonance and inductive effects affecting the anion, should have an acidity close to phenol."
Why does burnt hair smell bad?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/64159/why-does-burnt-hair-smell-bad,43k,"Hair is largely (~90%) composed of a protein called keratin, which originates in the hair follicle.
Now, keratin is composed of a variety of amino acids, including the sulfur containing amino acid, cysteine. All these amino acids are joined to each other by chemical bonds called peptide bonds to form these long chains that we call polypeptide chains. In the case of human hair, the polypeptide that we're talking about is keratin. The polypeptide chains are intertwined around each other in a helix shape.
The average composition of normal hair is 45.2 % carbon, 27.9% oxygen, 6.6% hydrogen, 15.1% nitrogen and 5.2% sulfur.

(I got that diagram off of Google Images)
Now, there are a whole bunch of chemical interactions that maintain the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins, such as van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, polypeptide linkages, ionic bonds, etc. But there is, however, one additional chemical interaction in proteins that contain the amino acids cysteine and methionine (both of which contain sulfur) called disulfide linkages. You can see that in the diagram above (it's been marked in yellow, which is fortunately, a very intuitive color when you're dealing with sulfur).

When you burn hair (or skin or nails... anything that has keratin in it for that matter) these disulfide linkages are broken. The sulfur atoms are now free to chemically combine with other elements present in the protein and air, such as oxygen and hydrogen. The volatile sulfur compounds formed as a result is what's responsible for the fetid odor of burning hair.
Quite a few of the ""bad smells"" we come across everyday are due to some sulfur containing compound or the other. A great example would be the smell of rotten eggs, which can be attributed to a volatile sulfur compound called hydrogen sulfide. Yet another example (as @VonBeche points out in the comments) would be that of tert-butylthiol, which is the odorant that is used to impart the characteristic smell of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)."

The real key piece of information is that given enough time, all the unsaturated bonds will be reduced. This tells you that though the reduction is thermodynamically favorable, it is the difference in the energy barriers ($\ce{\Delta \mathrm{G^{‡}}}$) that prevents the carbonyl reduction from occurring at the same rate as the alkene reduction. This means to produce the alcohol faster, we must manipulate the kinetics of the reaction.
To understand why the carbonyl-reduction transition state is higher in energy, we should consider the differences between the carbonyl and alkene bonds. The bonds are much more polarized, and as such the carbonyl $\pi$ bond is considerably stronger than alkene ($93\ \mathrm{kcal\ mol^{-1}}$ vs. $63\ \mathrm{kcal\ mol^{-1}}$)$^{\mathrm{[1]}}$. This means that at low temperatures, only a small fraction of the molecules have enough energy for the carbonyls to associate onto the $\ce{Pd/C}$ surface. Catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones, and especially esters) requires high temperatures and pressures to increase the presence of both the substrate and hydrogen on the catalyst.

What's the difference between a nucleophile and a base?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/20061/whats-the-difference-between-a-nucleophile-and-a-base,67k,"The two are related, in that most nucleophiles are (Lewis) bases and vice versa.

Nucleophilicity is a kinetic phenomenon.

Nucleophilicity is most often defined based on the relative rate of the reactions of nucleophiles with a standard substrate in a standard solvent.
For example, a standard reaction might look like:

The nucleophilicity will be related to the relative rate constant of reaction with the nucleophile (relative to the rate constant of the reaction with water $\equiv 1$).

When is it true that more nodes equals higher energy?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14578/when-is-it-true-that-more-nodes-equals-higher-energy,10k,"General case
There is indeed a mathematical theorem that deals with the number of nodes an eigenfunction corresponding to a certain eigenvalue can possess.
It was laid down by Courant$^{[1, 2]}$ and it states the following:

Given the self-adjoint second order (partial) differential equation
\begin{equation} \left(\hat{L} + \lambda \rho(\mathbf{x}) \right)
 u(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \end{equation}
(where $\hat{L} = L(\mathbf{\Delta}, \mathbf{x})$ is a linear,
  hermitian differential operator, $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ is positive and
  bounded, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue) for a domain $G$ with
  homogeneous boundary conditions, that is $u(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ on the
  boundary of the region $G$; if its eigenfunctions are  ordered
  according to increasing eigenvalues, then the nodes of the $n^{\text{th}}$ 
  eigenfunction divide the domain into no more than $n$ subdomains. The
  nodal set of $u(\mathbf{x})$ is defined as the set of points
  $\mathbf{x}$ such that $u(\mathbf{x}) = 0$. No assumptions are made
  about the number of independent variables.

The proof is rather involved and so I won't show it here. But if you want you can look it up in [1] or here.
So, Courant's nodal line theorem tells us, that if we order the possible energy eigenvalues of the time-independent Schroedinger equation as $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \lambda_3 \leq \dots$, then (depending on precisely how you set up the numbering) the  $n^{\text{th}}$ eigenfunction, $\Psi_{n}$ (the one with energy eigenvalue $\lambda_n$) has at most $n$ nodes (including the trivial one at the boundary $\mathbf{x} \to \infty$). 
Unfortunately, this gives you only an upper bound for the number of nodes a wave function with a certain energy eigenvalue may possess. So, all we know is that the ground state wave function $\Psi_{1}$ cannot have any nodes within the region $G$ (in total it has one node, namely the one at $\mathbf{x} \to \infty$). Wave functions for higher $n$ may possess up to $n-1$ nodes within $G$ but may as well have less. Thus, we cannot in general say that if a wave function has more nodes than another one it will automatically correspond to a state with higher energy.
Special case: Schroedinger equation in one dimension
There is however a special case:
For the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem (and thus for ordinary second order differential equations with homogeneous boundary conditions) we can strengthen Courant's nodal line theorem such that if we order the possible eigenvalues as $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \lambda_3 \leq \dots$, then the  $n^{\text{th}}$ eigenfunction (the one with energy eigenvalue $\lambda_n$) has exactly $n$ nodes (including the trivial one at the boundary $\mathbf{x} \to \infty$). 
This is useful since the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation is a special case of a Sturm-Liouville equation. So, in the case of the inhomogeneous radial Schrödinger equation with a local potential and node-less inhomogeneity such as the radial Schrödinger equation for the hydrogenic atom
\begin{equation}
\bigg( \frac{ - \hbar^{2} }{ 2 m_{\mathrm{e}} } \frac{ \mathrm{d}^{2} }{ \mathrm{d} r^{2} } + \frac{ \hbar^{2} }{ 2 m_{\mathrm{e}} } \frac{ \ell (\ell + 1) }{ r^{2} }  - \frac{ Z e^{2} }{ 2 m_{\mathrm{e}} r } - E \bigg) r R(r) = 0
\end{equation}
it is generally true that a wavefunction with more (radial) nodes must always correspond to a state of higher energy than a wavefunction with less radial nodes. Also, it is clear that the wavefunctions of the one-dimensional particle-in-a-box must follow this rule. But for the three-dimensional particle-in-a-box this is not true anymore, since in that case the Schroedinger equation of the system is not an ordinary second-order differential equation but a partial-differential equation for which only the general version of Courant's nodal line theorem holds.
Some concluding remarks
For real-world system like molecules or crystals the Schroedinger equation is a partial differential equation for which the special case outlined above doesn't apply so that only Courant's nodal line theorem in its general form holds which doesn't give a strict justification for the statement that more nodes mean higher energy. Yet it is very often observed that the number of nodes indeed increases with increasing energy.
The reason for this can be motivated in the following way: The kinetic energy $E_{\mathrm{kin}}$ of a state is proportional to $\int \Psi \Delta \Psi \, d^{3} r$. Via Gauss's theorem it can be shown that $\int \Psi \Delta \Psi \, d^{3} r \propto \int |\nabla \Psi |^{2} \, d^{3} r$ and so $E_{\mathrm{kin}} \propto \int | \nabla \Psi |^{2} d^{3} r$. Now, nodes force a wavefunction to change it's sign. This often means that the value of $\Psi$ has to increase/decrease rather rapidly thus leading to areas with high absolute values of the gradient and thus to high kinetic energy. Since the potential energies shouldn't differ too much between the different states the higher kinetic energy usually also entails a higher total energy. As an example consider the bonding and antibonding wavefunctions of a homonuclear diatomic molecule whose atoms are placed at the positions $r_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $r_{\mathrm{B}}$.

The bonding wavefunction has no nodes. Its value between the atoms doesn't have to undergo a rapid change and thus the slope is rather low. The antibonding wavefunction has one node between the atoms. Its value between the atoms must change rapidly from its positive to its negative maximum thus entailing a very high slope. The slopes of the tail regions are comparable for the bonding and antibonding wavefunctions since it can smoothly fall of to zero at infinity and is not required to go from a maximum value to zero within a very confined region of space - thus even if one wavefunction has to start of at a higher maximum value the gradient will not be much higher. It follows that the antibonding wavefunction has a higher kinetic energy than the bonding wavefunction.

Why is the bond length of CO+ less than that of CO?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/9510/why-is-the-bond-length-of-co-less-than-that-of-co,38k,"Unfortunately, the arguments presented by buckminst and Uncle Al aren't completely right. The MO schemes are correct but the HOMO-$\sigma$ orbital ($s_{\sigma}^{*}(5\sigma)$ in buckminst's diagramm, $\sigma_{3}$ in Uncle Al's diagram) is not antibonding but slightly bonding in character because there is some mixing with the $\ce{p}$ atomic orbitals of the right symmetry (in this respect the MO scheme of Uncle Al is better than the one of buckminst because it indicates this mixing).
So, the original problem still persists.
One possible explanation for the bond shortening after ionization is that the ionization leads to a shift of the $\ce{CO}$-electron-polarization (on ionization an electron is lost from the mostly $\ce{C}$-centered HOMO-$\sigma$ orbital and this leads to a formation of a positive partial charge on the $\ce{C}$ atom).
This strengthens the covalence of the $\ce{CO}$-bond and thus reduces the bond length (since the HOMO-$\sigma$ orbital is only slightly bonding there is not much bonding lost by taking away one of its electrons - the lost bonding is outweighed by the gain in covalency).
You can think of this strenghtening of the bond covalence in the following way: Two atomic orbitals can interact better (form stronger bonds) if their energies are close. Without the positive partial charge on $\ce{C}$ the AOs of $\ce{O}$ lie energetically a lot below the AOs of $\ce{C}$ (this is most pronounced for the $\ce{s}$ AOs which form the  HOMO-$\sigma*$ orbital). But with the positive partial charge on $\ce{C}$ the AOs of $\ce{C}$ are shifted down in energy and thus their energies are closer to the related AOs of $\ce{O}$ which leads to a stronger interaction when bonds are formed."

Explanation for the trends in nucleophilicity—Orbital interactions or electrostatic attraction,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/91254/explanation-for-the-trends-in-nucleophilicity-orbital-interactions-or-electrosta,10k,"This is a rather intellectually-stimulating question and one that is also very difficult to answer. You have constructed a very good case for why the nucleophilicity order would not be expected to reverse in polar aprotic solvents, i.e. the order of intrinsic nucleophilicities of the halide ions should be $\ce {I^- > Br^- > Cl^- > F^-}$, based on the concepts of frontier molecular orbital interactions, as well as electronegativity and polarisability of the nucleophilic atom. 
Affirming your viewpoint
Admittedly, the saturated carbon atom is a soft centre and based on electronegativity considerations, the energy of the $\ce {HOMO}$ of the halide ions should increase from $\ce {F^-}$ to $\ce {I^-}$, i.e. the hardness of the the halide ions as nucleophiles decreases from $\ce {F^-}$ to $\ce {I^-}$. Based on the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) principle, we would expect the the strength of the interaction between the halide ion and the carbon centre to increase from $\ce {F^-}$ to $\ce {I^-}$. 
We can provide more quantitative justification for this using the Klopman-Salem equation$\ce {^1}$:
$$\Delta E=\frac{Q_{\text{Nu}}Q_{\text{El}}}{\varepsilon R}+\frac{2(c_{\text{Nu}}c_{\text{El}}\beta)^2}{E_{\text{HOMO}(\text{Nu})}\pm E_{\text{LUMO}(\text{El})}}$$
The first term is indicative of the strength of the Coulombic interaction while the second term is indicative of the strength of the orbital interactions. In the reaction with the soft saturated carbon, it is actually expected for the reactivity to increase from $\ce {F^-}$ to $\ce {I^-}$ (ref 1, p. 117). 
At the moment, all the evidence presented points us towards the conclusion that you have posited. However, we have overlooked the importance of a thermodynamic factor - the strength of the $\ce {C-X}$ bond. 
A not-particularly-relevant add-on
Actually, if you think about it the considerations made in the Klopman-Salem equation are essentially kinetic considerations. We cannot conclude anything about reaction energetics from such considerations. The strength of the $\ce {HOMO-LUMO}$ interaction or that of the Coulombic attraction tells us nothing about how the electrons would organise themselves subsequently, what would be the strength of the resultant bonds etc. 
A comment made on this by Olmstead & Brauman (1977)
On this topic of explaining the relative order of intrinsic nucleophilicity of the halide ions, Olmstead & Brauman (1977) had this to say$\ce {^2}$:

The intrinsic nucleophilicities follow the reverse order of the polarizabilities (e.g., $\ce {CH3O^-}$ > $\ce {CH3S^-}$ and $\ce {F^-}$ > $\ce {Cl^-}$ > $\ce {Br^-}$). This could be due to a stronger interaction between the more concentrated molecular orbitals of the anion with the carbon center. It could also be simply a reflection of the greater thermodynamic methyl cation affinities of the smaller anions. 

It is important to note that Olmstead & Brauman are merely postulating the reasons. However, I do feel that the point on thermodynamics leads us on the right track to answering this question. On the other point of ""more concentrated MOs"", I am unclear of how it can be interpreted. 
Let us focus now on this point. 
How does thermodynamics even influence kinetics?
Well... It certainly does here. What are we concerned with when dealing with nucleophilicity? As it is a kinetic phenomenon, we are essentially concerned with the rate of the substitution reaction. This makes the consideration of the activation energy ($E_\mathrm{a}$) a particularly important one because the higher the $E_\mathrm{a}$, the lower the rate of the substitution reaction. 
Here, the $E_\mathrm{a}$ can be taken to be the difference in energy between the reactants and the transition state. Thus, we can decrease the $E_\mathrm{a}$ by either raising the energy level of reactants or decreasing the energy level of the transition state. The reaction energy profile for an $\ce {S_N2}$ reaction is shown below, taken from ref. 3 (p. 394). 

There are two ways to see how the strength of the $\ce {C-X}$ bond can affect the $E_\mathrm{a}$. I am not sure if they may be considered equivalent perspectives. Nonetheless, I will present both. 
The first perspective is well-explained by Francis & Sundberg (2007) with regard to the $\ce {S_N2}$ reaction$\ce {^3}$:

Because the $\ce {S_N2}$ process is concerted, the strength of the partially formed new bond is reflected in the TS. A stronger bond between the nucleophilic atom and carbon atom results in a more stable TS and a reduced activation energy. 

Another perspective (which may be somewhat similar to the first, or even possibly the same) is that the transition state structure bears resemblance to the product structure, based on the Hammond's postulate. However, this would be more applicable for an endothermic $\ce {S_N2}$ reaction where the transition state structure does indeed bear more resemblance to the product. When the product is more stable, i.e. has bonds that form more exothermically, the energy of the transition state would thus be lowered, and the $E_\mathrm{a}$ would also decrease, although not necessarily proportionally. 
Conclusion 
The argument you have presented failed to consider the important thermodynamics factor. Thus, it resulted in the predicted reactivity of the halide ions in the reversed order. The takeaway here is that the application of the $\ce {HSAB}$ concept alone does not always produce the correct prediction. 
Additional information
More examples are cited for which the HSAB concept fails. These include:

The favourable combination of $\ce {H^+}$, a hard acid, and $\ce {H^-}$, a soft base (discussed here as well) (ref. 4). 
The fact that the rate of reaction between $\ce {Ag^+}$, soft acid, and an alkene, soft base, is slower than that between $\ce {Ag^+}$ and $\ce {OH^-}$, a hard base (ref. 1, p. 110)

Where did amino acids get their one-letter codes?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/66109/where-did-amino-acids-get-their-one-letter-codes,16k,"Tryptophan

For instance, is there a reason 'W' specifically was chosen for tryptophan (other than the fact that 'T' was taken)?

Once you have assigned the other 19 amino acids, there are only 7 letters of the alphabet left: B, J, O, U, W, X, and Z. (Certainly not a nice Scrabble hand to have!)
If one wants to use a letter found within the name of the amino acid, the only available letter would be O. However, the usage of U and O was historically discouraged because these letters could be easily confused with other letters (U with V; O with G, Q, C, D, and the number 0).
It turns out that the choice was made because W is a very fat letter and was reminiscent of the indole ring system present in tryptophan (the only amino acid to contain a bicyclic system). (See below for source.)

What happened to the other six letters, then?
All 26 letters of the alphabet now find use as a one-letter code for amino acids or various combinations thereof.
After their discoveries, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine (the latter only found in bacteria) were assigned U and O respectively. Furthermore, B is used to represent aspartic acid OR asparagine; J is used to represent leucine OR isoleucine; Z is used to represent glutamic acid OR glutamine; and X is used to represent an unknown amino acid.
I believe B and Z find use because, in protein sequencing, acid hydrolysis is often used to break peptide bonds. This has the undesirable side-effect of hydrolysing the amide groups in asparagine/glutamine, leading to the formation of aspartic/glutamic acids, which means that one cannot tell exactly which amino acid it was at the start. J is used in NMR spectroscopy where isoleucine and leucine are difficult to distinguish.

Why did they choose the letters they did?
As far as I am aware the usage of one-letter symbols is adopted by both IUPAC and IUB (since 1991, IUBMB) in their joint 1983 recommendations on ""Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides"".1 ankit7540's concise summary of the historical development already mentioned these recommendations.
In particular, Section 3AA-21.2 ""The Code Symbols"" has a description of why the letters were chosen. This document is probably the most authoritative stance on the matter. The rationale is mostly in line with Jan's answer:

Initial letters of the names of the amino acids were chosen where there was no ambiguity. There are six such cases: cysteine, histidine. isoleucine, methionine, serine, and valine. All the other amino acids share the initial letters A, G, L, P or T, so arbitrary assignments were made. These letters were assigned to the most frequently occurring and structurally most simple of the amino acids with these initials, alanine (A), glycine (G), leucine (L), proline (P) and threonine (T).
Other assignments were made on the basis of associations that might be helpful in remembering the code, e.g. the phonetic associations of F for phenylalanine and R for arginine. For tryptophan the double ring of the molecule is associated with the bulky letter W. The letters N and Q were assigned to asparagine and glutamine respectively; D and E to aspartic and glutamic acids respectively. K and Y were chosen for the two remaining amino acids, lysine and tyrosine, because, of the few remaining letters, they were close alphabetically to the initial letters of the names. U and O were avoided because U is easily confused with V in handwritten material, and O with G, Q, C and D in imperfect computer print-outs, and also with zero. J was avoided because it is absent from several languages.
Two other symbols are often necessary for partly determined sequences, so B was assigned to aspartic acid or asparagine when these have not been distinguished; Z was similarly assigned to glutamic acid or glutamine. X means that the identity of an amino acid is undetermined, or that the amino acid is atypical.

One can only hypothesise what they meant by ""associations that might be helpful in remembering the code"" in the case of N/Q/D/E. My best guess is:

D and E were possibly chosen for aspartic and glutamic acids because they were the only consecutive pair of letters left, emphasising their chemical similarity. Aspartic acid is shorter than glutamic acid by one methylene group (CH2), so it gets the earlier letter D.
Glutamine sounds like Q-tamine. If you don't think it sounds similar, repeat it 50 times until you do.
AsparagiNe was assigned N.

Why is methanol toxic?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/21915/why-is-methanol-toxic,14k,"Methanol isn't particularly toxic in and of itself, although it's no walk in the park.
If methanol flowed through the body without being broken down, it would cause roughly the same kind of harm as ethanol, i.e. intoxication.
The real culprit is one of its metabolic products, methanoic acid, also known as formic acid.
To understand how formic acid, present as the formate ion, is toxic, we look to Wikipedia:

Formate is toxic because it inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, causing the symptoms of hypoxia at the cellular level, and also causing metabolic acidosis, among a variety of other metabolic disturbances.

Edit: As DavePhD points out, an intermediate product in this process is formaldehyde, or methanal. While formaldehyde is also toxic, it is rapidly metabolized to methanoic acid.
Reedit: The deeper, more historical reason that this happens is that methanol isn't readily available in nature, meaning that few species have developed biochemical tools to deal with it. There simply hasn't existed an evolutionary pressure to deal with methanol."
Why are solids and liquids not included in the equilibrium constant? What about in a reaction rate calculation?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14058/why-are-solids-and-liquids-not-included-in-the-equilibrium-constant-what-about,69k,"It very much depends on what definition of the equilibrium constant you are looking. The most common usage of the same has quite a variety of possible setups, see goldbook:

Equilibrium Constant
  Quantity characterizing the equilibrium of a chemical reaction and defined by an expression of the type $$K_x = \Pi_B x_B^{\nu_B},$$ where $\nu_B$ is the stoichiometric number of a reactant (negative) or product (positive) for the reaction and $x$ stands for a quantity which can be the equilibrium value either of pressure, fugacity, amount concentration, amount fraction, molality, relative activity or reciprocal absolute activity defining the pressure based, fugacity based, concentration based, amount fraction based, molality based, relative activity based or standard equilibrium constant (then denoted $K^\circ$ ), respectively.

The standard equilibrium constant is always unitless, as it is defined differently (goldbook)

Standard Equilibrium Constant $K$, $K^\circ$ (Synonym: thermodynamic equilibrium constant)
  Quantity defined by $$K^\circ = \exp\left\{-\frac{\Delta_rG^\circ}{RT}\right\}$$  where $\Delta_rG^\circ$  is the standard reaction Gibbs energy, $R$  the gas constant and $T$  the thermodynamic temperature. Some chemists prefer the name thermodynamic equilibrium constant and the symbol $K$.

It is worthwhile to note, that the first definition is always an approximation to the standard definition and in the standard definition all compounds regardless of their state are included in the equilibrium.
If you are looking at a reaction that takes place in gas phase, solid materials will play a constant role, since their partial pressure will solely depend on their vapour pressure and can therefore be regarded as constant. Therefore it can be seen as a part of the equilibrium constant. (The same applies to liquids while deriving for gas phase.) If you would increase the amount of solid in the system you would still not change it's concentration in gas phase.
For the reaction $$\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (s) <=> 2HI (g)}$$ you can form the standard equilibrium constant with activities/ fugacities
$$K^\circ = \frac{a^2(\ce{HI})}{a(\ce{H2})\cdot{}a(\ce{I2})},$$
with $$a=\frac{f}{p^\circ}.$$
The activity for a pure solid is normally defined as one ($a(\ce{I2})=1$) and therefore
$$K^\circ\approx K = \frac{a^2(\ce{HI})}{a(\ce{H2})}$$

For concentration dependent equilibrium constants, the following assumption is to be considered: $c(\ce{H2O})\approx55.6~\mathrm{mol/L}$ and is usually always much larger than that of any other component of the system in the range where the equilibrium approximation can be used. Also in most solution based reactions, the solute itself does not directly influence the reaction. Its concentration will therefore not change (significantly) and can be included in the equilibrium constant.

You are correct in assuming that the kinetics of a surface reaction will only depend of the actual area of the surface (and of course the reactants forming the products). But here again this area is most likely to be considered as constant and will result in a scalar for the reaction rate (in the area where an accurate description of the reaction is possible). 
As of Greg's comment, He is of course right. In an equilibrium process the surface area will affect both directions of the reaction, hence it will not show up in the reaction rate at all. (The only effect it might have is, that the equilibrium state will be reached faster.)"
What is Drago's rule? Does it really exist?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/64613/what-is-dragos-rule-does-it-really-exist,34k,"Going through what you posted, I think ‘Drago’s rule’ (which I never encountered, either at school or at university) gives good predictions but uses a largely terrible set of arguments.
For any atomic system with more than one electron, quantum chemistry predicts the energies of the $\mathrm{s}$ and $\mathrm{p}$ subshells of a shell to differ — while for hydrogen-like systems (one-electron systems) all subshells of a given shell have the same energy. The $\mathrm{s}$ subshell of a certain shell in multi-electron systems has a lower energy than the $\mathrm{p}$ subshell, which in turn has a (far) lower energy than the $\mathrm{d}$ subshell and so on and so forth. Since the $\mathrm{s}$ subshell is determined to be more stable by this method, it is not surprising that the first two electrons of a given shell are added to said $\mathrm{s}$ subshell; the next six electrons are added to $\mathrm{p}$ subshells whereafter a new shell is used.
This immediately explains that it is most stable for any atom to treat the $\mathrm{s}$ electrons of its valence shell as ‘extended core electrons’; i.e. we can predict any configuration that does not touch the $\mathrm{s}$ electrons to be energetically favourable with respect to any configuration that does a priori. (You can consider that part of the quoted statement to be correct.) Therefore, the a priori predicted most stable configurations of certain coordination numbers are:

mono-, di- and tri-coordination: use 1, 2 or 3 $\mathrm{p}$ orbitals to form bonds; keep one lone pair in an $\mathrm{s}$ type orbital. (Predicted bond angle: $90^\circ$.)

tetracoordination (no additional lone pairs): since the former is not possible, hybridise $\mathrm{s}$ and $\mathrm{p}$ orbitals to form $\mathrm{sp^3}$ hybrid orbitals. (Predicted bond angle: $109.5^\circ$.) Actually, in MO terms you should consider the four ligands to supply four group orbitals whose symmetry always fits one of the three central atom’s orbitals, resulting in one lower bond energy and one higher bond energy corresponding to triple-degenerate bonds. The $\mathrm{sp^3}$ description is mathematically equivalent, though.

penta- and hexacoordination; tetracoordination with additioal lone pairs and related: attempt to form as many normal bonds with p orbitals as possible; keep one lone pair in an $\mathrm{s}$ orbital if possible. Use remaining $\mathrm{p}$ orbitals to construct four-electron-3-centre bonds to the remaining atoms. (Predicted bond angles: diverse. $90^\circ$ going from 2e2c bonds to 4e3c bonds; $180^\circ$ between a pair of coordinating atoms contributing to the same 4e3c bond.)


Using the aforementioned 4e3c bonds nicely explains why electronegative atoms prefer to occupy these positions. You should always remember that 4e3c bonds can be described by the following resonance structures (drawn for $\ce{ClF3}$):
$$\ce{F-Cl^+\bond{...}F- <-> F^-\bond{...}Cl^+-F}$$
In this resonance, each outer atom taking part in a 4e3c bond has a formal average charge of $-0.5$; it is generally better to assign charges to electronegative atoms.

The theories I have outlined so far do not adequately predict the bond angles of water, ammonia and related compounds. Indeed, these compounds are remarkably complicated although they seem simple. The gist, however, is that a bond angle of $90^\circ$, while being most favourable on a pure orbital basis, introduces steric strain between the outer atoms which approach each other too closely if the central atom is relatively small. To combat this destabilisation, the bond angle is extended by mixing $\mathrm{s}$-contribution into the bonding orbitals — which in turn means that the lone pair will be less $\mathrm{s}$-like. The ideal bond angle for dicoordinated systems based on sterics is $180^\circ$, showing that the electronic contribution ($90^\circ$) is more important than the steric one ($180^\circ$). Larger central atoms than oxygen and nitrogen, such as phosphorus, antimony, selenium, etc., allow for smaller bond angles since the bond lengths are larger increasing the spacing between the ligands.
The reason for the special behaviour of nitrogen and oxygen is not their high electronegativity but their small size. Chlorine, which has an electronegativity similar to nitrogen, behaves as predicted for large atoms.

It has been commented that you should not invoke $\mathrm{d}$ orbital participation for main group elements. Remember what I said in the second paragraph: a shell’s $\mathrm{d}$ subshell has a higher energy than the next shell’s s subshell. Thus, before any same-shell $\mathrm{d}$ subshell is added to hybridisation, the next shell’s $\mathrm{s}$ subshell should be. Since hybridisations involving two different shells’ $\mathrm{s}$ subshells are not observed, we should reject the possibility of using $\mathrm{d}$ orbitals for hybridisation. Therefore, we can also flat-out reject the central two paragraphs of your quotation."
Sp5 hybridization in cyclopropane?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/37255/sp5-hybridization-in-cyclopropane,16k,"Until this post, $\mathrm{sp^1,~sp^2~\text{and}~sp^3}$ meant for me, that the hybrid orbitals would consist from one s orbital and one, two or three p orbitals. I thought of it being so, as this seems to be what the most textbooks suggest, as can be seen in the following image:

One 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals hybridize to four $\mathrm{sp^3}$ orbitals.
This scheme seems to work but it also seems to be a working simplification as can be seen by my question about $\mathrm{sp^5}$ hybrid orbitals, which simply cannot consist from one s orbital and five p orbitals, as there are only three p orbitals in reach.
Then what does this nomenclature actually mean?
As Martin commented, it is more like the following:
$$\mathrm{sp^n \equiv s^\frac{1}{n+1}p^\frac{n}{n+1}}$$ or to say it slightly different, a $\mathrm{sp^n}$-bond has

It turns out for $p$ valence shell ions that an isotropic ionic radius only occurs on cubic lattice sites. For all other site symmetries, however, two or three radial parameters will apply. Appropriate geometric shapes for $p$ valence shell ions are thus given by ellipsoids instead of spheres.

The $p$ valence ion in this case being sulphide.  With this model in mind, the explanation provided in the caption for this diagram states:

The mesh inscribed into the sulfur ions now reveals the ellipsoidal compression along <111> directions. In this model, the number of contact points of $\ce{S}$ and $\ce{Fe}$ ions become four and six, respectively, and the ellipsoidal deformation is concluded to enable a stable packing.

The molecular shape does not necessarily mean that the pyrite crystal has a cubic shape, however if the conditions are right (pressure and temperature), and the composition is 'correct' - if the formation is in a iron rich environment (as per the first reference), then this molecular shape could express as a cubic crystal."
Relative stability of cis and trans cycloalkenes,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/30940/relative-stability-of-cis-and-trans-cycloalkenes,18k,"Usually trans-olefins are more stable than their cis isomers for steric reasons, like you suggested.  However in small and medium size rings this is not the case; here the cis-cycloalkene is more stable than the corresponding  trans isomer.
trans-Cyclooctene is the smallest trans-cycloalkene that is stable at room temperature (trans-cyclohexene and trans-cycloheptene have been detected as short-lived intermediates).  In your drawing up above of trans-cyclodecene (a) draw in the two hydrogens on the trans double bond.  One of them is ""inside"" the ring and causes steric problems with the carbons on the other side of the ring as pictured below.  Because of this destabilizing transannular interaction trans-cycloalkenes with up to around 11 carbons do not exist as planar molecules.  They exist in a conformation as pictured below for trans-cyclooctene.
 
(image source)
If you can, build a model of trans-cyclooctene.  Notice how you have to pull and stretch the methylene chain in order to attach that last methylene back onto the other end of the double bond - there is a lot of strain in this molecule. Now build a model of cis-cyclooctene; it is easy to loop the methylene chain from one end of the double bond to the other end.  
Not until you get to around trans-cyclododecene (12 carbons) do you have enough carbons to easily connect from one end of the trans double bond back to the other end.  trans-Cycloalkenes with less than 12 carbons have additional strain because of this difficulty in spanning the double bond. Once you get to around 12 carbons there is no difficulty spanning the double bond and so once again trans-cycloalkenes become more stable than their cis counterparts.
Since double bond carbons are $\mathrm{sp^2}$ hybridized with 120° angles, if we add more double bonds, the 120° angles make it more difficult to loop the more flexible $\mathrm{sp^3}$ methylene (with their 109.5° angles) chain around the double bonds."
Why are there only 7 types of unit cells and 14 types of Bravais lattices?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/35273/why-are-there-only-7-types-of-unit-cells-and-14-types-of-bravais-lattices,23k,"All quotes will be from Solid State Physics by Ashcroft and Mermin.
Bravais Lattice:

A fundamental concept in the description of any crystalline solid is that of the Bravais lattice, which specifies the periodic array in which the repeated units of the crystal are arranged.  The units themselves may be single atoms, groups of atoms, molecules, ions, etc., but the Bravais lattice summarizes only the geometry of the underlying periodic structure, regardless of what the actual units may be.""

Primitive Unit Cell:

A volume of space that, when translated through all the vectors in a Bravais lattice, just fills all of space without either overlapping itself or leaving voids is called a primitive cell or primitive unit cell of the lattice.

Unit Cell; Conventional Unit Cell:

One can fill space up with nonprimitive unit cells (known simply as unit cells or conventional unit cells). A unit cell is a region that just fills space without any overlapping when translated through some subset of the vectors of a Bravais lattice. The conventional unit cell is generally chosen to be bigger than the primitive cell and to have the required symmetry.

Crystal Structure:

A physical crystal can be described by giving its underlying Bravais lattice, together with a description of the arrangement of atoms, molecules, ions, etc. within a particular primitive cell.

So, one comes up with 14 Bravais lattices from symmetry considerations, divided into 7 crystal systems (cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic,monoclinic, triclinic, trigonal, and hexagonal). This comes solely by enumerating the ways in which a periodic array of points can exist in 3 dimensions.
Now, what is on those points is a unit cell, which will itself have some symmetry. Thus, the combination of Bravais lattice and unit cell symmetry can again be enumerated and one comes up with 230 space groups. 
Now for some of your related questions: 
All cubic-related Bravais lattices will have 90 degree angles because they are based on cubic symmetry.  The trigonal Bravais lattice has no 90 degree angles, but isn't talked about much in more basic textbooks because, well, it looks weird.
Why no pentagonal unit cells? Well, because you can't fill space with a 5-fold symmetric Bravais lattice. Quasicrystals, while they have 5-fold symmetry, are a tiling through space that does not obey the rules for a Bravais lattice."
Why does the unstabilised Wittig reaction selectively form cis alkenes?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5313/why-does-the-unstabilised-wittig-reaction-selectively-form-cis-alkenes,22k,"To my knowledge the mechanism of the Wittig reaction isn't fully resolved yet. But maybe I can give you some ideas about why the Wittig reaction with unstabilized ylides is (Z)-selective (well, with the exception of the Schlosser modification) instead of (E)-selective.
In the excellent book by Clayden, Warren, and Greeves, there is a section beginning p. 690 that describes the oxaphosphetane formation as a concerted, antarafacial [2+2]-cycloaddition reaction (similar to your ""puckered transition state"").
Here, the phosphonium ylide and the carbonyl compound approach each other at right angles. The substituents are arranged in order to minimise steric repulsions in the transition state. In particular, the phenyl group (Ph) points away from the PPh3 group, and then the R group on the ylide points away from the Ph.

The formation of the oxaphosphetane is irreversible and kinetically controlled. Hence, even though the trans oxaphosphetane is more stable, it is not formed.
(By the way, the book also has some justification why the Wittig reaction of stabilized ylides is E-selective.)

Edit:
Since the OP asked for it I will try to give some justification on why the ylide and the carbonyl group approach one another perpendicularly. For a proper description one would need the frontier orbitals of both compounds and then reason about the orbital interactions that bring about the [2+2] cycloaddition. Since I don't have those I will try to give some oversimplified description that should convey the general principle at work here. In the approximate orbital pictures I'm going to use I'll leave out the substituents for clarity.
To begin with, if one imagines the orbital interactions between the ylide and the carbonyl group, it is clear that the most important (primary) interaction for the reaction is the one between the HOMO of the ylide (nucleophile) and the LUMO of the carbonyl group (electrophile). What happens when both groups approach one another head-on or at right angles is shown in the following picture (for the perpendicular approach a top-view is used).

In both cases there are as many bonding interactions (black) as there are antibonding interactions (red). These situations are overall non-bonding and cannot lead to the desired product. This is the reason why [2+2] cycloadditions are usually thermally forbidden (by symmetry).
However, some compounds have additional orbitals that: (1) are similar in energy to the frontier orbitals drawn in the picture, and (2) possess the right symmetry to interact with the other orbitals. These ""secondary orbital interactions"" are weaker than the HOMO-LUMO interaction, but might provide enough bonding to tip the balance from an overall non-bonding to a bonding situation.
So, how does this translate to the situation of the Wittig reaction? Since O is more electronegative than C, the HOMO of the carbonyl group will have a larger orbital coefficient at O, while the LUMO will have a larger orbital coefficient at C. The situation is similar with the ylide. Since C is more electronegative than P, the HOMO of the ylide group will have a larger orbital coefficient at C. The ylide group is the nucleophile so the primary interaction will be between its HOMO and the LUMO of the electrophilic carbonyl group. Since the orbitals interact best where the coefficients are large, this primary interaction will be biased towards C–C bonding.
The question is now, is there a suitable secondary interaction? One can argue that P has a lot of orbitals (valence shell extension) and that the LUMO of the ylide might be some empty phosphorus orbital (or at least an orbital with a big coefficient on $\ce{P}$) - this could be a p-orbital perpendicular to the ylide's C=P π-orbitals, or a d-orbital, or something like that. This phosphorus orbital can then interact with the carbonyl group's HOMO, which has its biggest coefficient on O. So this bonding interaction will be biased towards P–O bonding. The situation is shown in the following picture:

The biases in the primary and secondary orbital interactions will lead to some distortions from the pure perpendicular approach which will become more pronounced the nearer the two species get to each other. For example, the ylide might rotate a bit so that its C and P atoms are closer to the carbonyl's C and O atoms respectively, in order to maximize the bonding overlap. And of course the perpendicular approach of ylide and carbonyl group will proceed in such a way that their respective biggest substituents are as far away from each other as possible (see diagram above).
After this quite lengthy answer I want to make clear that this description of mine is only a guess. The real reaction path is still a matter of debate and there are some compounds that rather react via a radical or ionic pathway. But I think it gives a good explanation for most of the observed behaviour and hope it helped the understanding. A more exact frontier orbital description of another thermal [2+2] cycloaddition, namely that of ketene with ethene, can be found in the textbook by Brueckner on p 653."
"What is the pKa of the hydronium, or oxonium, ion (H3O+)?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/9847/what-is-the-pka-of-the-hydronium-or-oxonium-ion-h3o,35k,"The controversy surrounding the $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ of hydronium mostly arises from the definition of $K_\mathrm{a}$ or lack thereof.  
There is no IUPAC definition of $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ or $K_\mathrm{a}$.  
The closest IUPAC defined term is the standard equilibrium constant, which can be denoted as $K^\circ$ or just $K$.
Physical chemistry texts such as Levine and respected works such Bates's ""Determination of pH — Theory and Practice"" define $K^\circ_\mathrm{a}$ of an acid in water as:
$$\frac{a(\ce{A-})a(\ce{H3O+})}{a(\ce{HA})a(\ce{H2O})} \tag{1}$$
Where $a$ is activity.  
Substituting that the acid is $\ce{H3O+}$:
$$\frac{a(\ce{H2O})a(\ce{H3O+})}{a(\ce{H3O+})a(\ce{H2O})} = 1 \tag{2}$$ 
and of course $-\log(1) = 0$.
The number $-1.74$ that some quote for the hydronium $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ comes from:

omitting the activity of water from the denominator of the $K^\circ_\mathrm{a}$ definition (equation $(1)$); and
taking the concentration of water (about $55.5~\mathrm{M}$) as the $K_\mathrm{a}$ of $\ce{H3O+}$.

With that, one obtains the $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ as $-\log (55.5) = -1.74$.  For example, Levine even has the $-1.74$ value in a figure comparing the $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$'s of various acids, but has a footnote explaining that the value for $\ce{H3O+}$ is based upon the alternative $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ definition.   
However, revisiting the analysis that $K^\circ_\mathrm{a} =1$ is probably the most authoritative paper on this issue:
New point of view on the meaning and on the values of Ka(H3O+, H2O) and Kb(H2O, OH-) pairs in water, which insists that 
$$\ce{H2O + H3O+ <=> H3O+ + H2O}$$
""does not correspond to an actual chemical process"" and therefore ""it is not legitimate"" to extend the concept of $K^\circ_\mathrm{a}$ to $\ce{H3O+}$ in water.
The article goes on to say that only by studying the $K_\mathrm{a}$ of $\ce{H3O+}$ in another solvent such as ethanol can $\ce{H3O+}$ be compared to other acids.
The $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ of $\ce{H3O+}$ in ethanol is $0.3$ and $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ values are $1.0 \pm 0.3$ units lower in water than in ethanol, so the article suggests a $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ of $-0.7$ for $\ce{H3O+}$ in water, for the purpose of comparison to other acids."
Which is the densest gas known?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/16439/which-is-the-densest-gas-known,25k,"Perfluorobutane is inert and has almost twice the density of sulfur hexafluoride. It is non-toxic enough that it is used in fire extinguishers and injected as a contrast agent for ultrasound. Boiling point: $-1.7\ \mathrm{^\circ C}$.
Perfluoropentane is similar and rarer but somewhat higher density $(\sim13\ \mathrm{kg/m^3})$ in proportion to its higher molecular mass. Its boiling point is $28\ \mathrm{^\circ C}$ (uncomfortably warm, but your thermostat can go that high). This is the densest gas that strictly meets all the criteria in the OP.
If we relax the criteria a bit:
Perfluorohexane is just over the boiling point limit at $56\ \mathrm{^\circ C}$, but it has a molar mass of $338\ \mathrm{g/mol}$ which makes it slightly denser in gas form than tungsten hexafluoride ($\ce{WF6}$).  It's also inert and non-toxic, unlike $\ce{WF6}$.
The ultimate gas density would be uranium hexachloride using depleted uranium and $\ce{Cl-37}$, with a molar mass of $460\ \mathrm{g/mol}$, which makes it over 50 % denser in gas form than tungsten hexafluoride, and 3 times denser than sulfur hexafluoride, but it has a boiling point of $75\ \mathrm{^\circ C}$, decomposes on contact with air, is toxic and slightly radioactive."
Are there non-transparent gases?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32640/are-there-non-transparent-gases,13k,"First, a little bit of background. Transparency is not an absolute property of a material. Every substance is opaque, so long as light has to pass through enough of it, and opacity also changes according to ambient conditions.  Some substances, such as most metals, are opaque even in $100\ \mathrm{nm}$ thin films, while many gasses will let a small amount of light through mostly unperturbed even after several kilometres. For example, here is a measure of how far photons of different energies can travel on average in the pure elements before interacting once with their atoms (the graph is actually for high energy x-rays rather than visible wavelengths, but they're all photons nonetheless). It makes intuitive sense that a gas should let more light through, as the atoms in it are much more spaced than in a solid or liquid.
The two general processes that work to make materials non-transparent are photon absorption and photon scattering (reflection being included as an example of scattering). When we say a material is ""transparent"" colloquially, what we generally mean is that the material, at the thickness observed, does not scatter much light and thus allows a coherent image to pass through the material (basically, you can see through it to the other side without a lot of distortion, that is, the object is ""see-through"" or clear). Interestingly, this means that a clear material need not be colourless, as correctly pointed out by Geoff, because photons of a given colour may be absorbed while letting most other wavelengths pass through without scattering.
Gasses in general are highly transparent because they are both highly colourless (absorb little light) and very clear (scatter little light) unless you're looking through several kilometres of gas, as I mentioned previously. However, there are examples of highly clear but coloured gasses, as it is possible for them to absorb a significant amount of photons of a certain energy due to low energy electronic transitions, while allowing the rest of the visible spectrum to pass through unimpeded. While some gasses are coloured and others are not, I believe all pure gasses must be very clear (small amounts of gas will scatter almost no light), and they can only scatter a fair amount of light across a short distance in conditions where they are probably not best described as gasses anymore (plasmas, supercritical fluids, etc).
Perhaps the most classic example of a coloured gas is nitrogen dioxide, $\ce{NO2}$, a strongly brown-red noxious gas which is easily formed by decomposition of nitric acid, among several other ways. The unpaired electron in its structure is somewhat uncommon, and it can be easily excited to a higher electronic state upon absorption of photons in the blue region of the visible spectrum. Since blue light is strongly absorbed even in relatively thin samples (a few centimetres of $\ce{NO2}$ gas), the rest of the white light passes through with essentially no scattering, forming a perfect image of the other side but with a strong red tinge.
Even more interestingly, $\ce{NO2}$ reacts with itself at low temperatures or high pressures and dimerizes to form dinitrogen tetroxide, $\ce{N2O4}$, a colourless solid/liquid/gas (depending on conditions). In other words, the two substances are in a reversible equilibrium:
$$\ce{2 NO2 (g) <=> N2O4 (g) + energy}$$
Coincidentally, this equilibrium is characterized by an equilibrium constant which is close to 1 at ambient conditions, and this constant can easily be changed by varying temperature or pressure to higher or lower values. This means that under relatively easily achieved conditions, it is possible to study the reversible change of a coloured gas into a colourless one! 

(Source)
Though I focused on $\ce{NO2}$ because it is a remarkable case, there are several other examples of clear but coloured gasses. As Geoff mentioned, the halogens all form coloured gasses, though bromine is a volatile liquid and iodine is a solid at room temperature, so a small amount of heating is necessary. Ozone, $\ce{O3}$, is somewhat blue (source), though its colour is best observed in the liquid phase. The same goes for oxygen gas, $\ce{O2}$, which is slightly blue, though it is not the cause for the blue sky. There are probably a few more examples out there."
What roles do neutrons play in an atom?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/66618/what-roles-do-neutrons-play-in-an-atom,33k,"Neutrons bind with protons and one another in the nucleus through the strong force, effectively moderating the repulsive forces between the protons and stabilizing the nucleus.$^{[1]}$
$\ce{^2He}$ (2 protons, 0 neutrons) is extremely unstable, though according to theoretical calculations would be much more stable if the strong force were 2% stronger. Its instability is due to spin–spin interactions in the strong force, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which forces the two protons to have anti-aligned spins and gives the $\ce{^2He}$ nucleus a negative binding energy. $\ce{^3He}$ (2 protons, 1 neutron), on the other hand, is stable, and is also the only stable isotope other than $\ce{^1H}$ with more protons than neutrons.$^{[2]}$

What is the physical basis for Hund's first rule?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/58625/what-is-the-physical-basis-for-hunds-first-rule,12k,"Disclaimer
My following answer is the ""traditional"" explanation of Hund's first rule, which is based on a smaller value of $V_\mathrm{ee}$ (electron-electron repulsions) in the triplet state arising from Fermi holes. According to Levine's Quantum Chemistry 7th ed.:

This traditional explanation turns out to be wrong in most cases. It is true that the probability that the two electrons are very close together is smaller for the helium $^3S$ $1s2s$ term than for the $^1S$ $1s2s$ term. However, calculations with accurate wave functions show that the probability that the two electrons are very far apart is also less for the $^3S$ term. The net result is that the average distance between the two electrons is slightly less for the $^3S$ term than for the $^1S$ term, and the interelectronic repulsion is slightly greater for the $^3S$ term.
The calculations show that the $^3S$ term lies below the $^1S$ term because of a substantially greater electron nucleus-attraction in the $^3S$ term as compared with the $^1S$ term. Similar results are found for terms of the atoms beryllium and carbon.

Wildcat has an answer which briefly mentions this. Aside from that Levine gives several references:

With that said, here is the old-fashioned argument for why parallel spins are favoured over paired spins (all else being equal).

Introduction
The origin of Hund's first rule lies in ""exchange energy"", which is a way of saying that electrons with like spin repel each other less than electrons with unlike spin.
To see why, let's consider an excited state of the helium atom: $\mathrm{1s^1 2s^1}$. (The ground state configuration $\mathrm{1s^2}$ is of no use to us because those electrons have to be paired with unlike spin.) In the excited state, the electrons can either have parallel spin (the triplet case) or paired spin (the singlet case).
The total electronic wavefunction comprises a spatial part, which describes which orbitals the electrons are in (i.e. it specifies $n,l,m_l$), and a spin part, which describes the, well, spin ($m_s$). According to the Pauli exclusion principle, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to interchange of the electron labels: $\Psi(1,2) = -\Psi(2,1)$.
Spin wavefunctions
The spin wavefunctions are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the $\hat{S}^2$ and $\hat{S}_z$ operators. The total spin quantum number, $S$, can be found from the eigenvalue of the operator $\hat{S}^2$:
$$\hat{S}^2\psi = \hbar^2 S(S+1)\psi$$
For more detailed discussion, refer to any QM text on the coupling of angular momenta.
There are three possible triplet spin wavefunctions, which are degenerate.
$$\psi_{\mathrm{spin,triplet}}(1,2) = \begin{cases}
\alpha(1)\alpha(2) \\
\beta(1)\beta(2) \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\alpha(1)\beta(2) + \alpha(2)\beta(1)]
\end{cases}$$
It turns out that $\hat{S}^2\psi_\mathrm{triplet} = 2\hbar^2\psi_{\mathrm{triplet}}$, which means that these have the quantum number $S = 1$. This corresponds to a multiplicity of $M = 2S + 1 = 3$, hence ""triplet"". These wavefunctions represent the case where the electrons have parallel spin. (Loosely speaking, each electron has a spin of $1/2$, and if these are aligned parallel the total spin is $1/2 + 1/2 = 1$.)
The singlet state is
$$\psi_{\mathrm{spin,singlet}}(1,2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\alpha(1)\beta(2) - \alpha(2)\beta(1)]$$
and as you might guess, $\hat{S}^2\psi_\mathrm{singlet} = 0$, meaning that $S = 0$ and $M = 2S+1 = 1$. This represents the case where the electrons are paired - one can think of it as the two $1/2$ electrons spins “cancelling each other out”.
The important thing to notice is that the triplet spin wavefunctions are symmetric with respect to permutation of the labels, whereas the singlet spin wavefunction is antisymmetric. For example:
$$\begin{align}
\psi_\mathrm{singlet}(2,1) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\alpha(2)\beta(1) - \alpha(1)\beta(2)] \\
&= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\alpha(1)\beta(2) - \alpha(2)\beta(1)] \\
&= -\psi_\mathrm{singlet}(1,2)
\end{align}$$
Spatial wavefunctions
The only way of constructing these are the linear combinations below.
$$\begin{align}
\psi_\mathrm{space,symm} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\mathrm{1s}(1)\mathrm{2s}(2) + \mathrm{1s}(2)\mathrm{2s}(1)] \\
\psi_\mathrm{space,antisymm} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\mathrm{1s}(1)\mathrm{2s}(2) - \mathrm{1s}(2)\mathrm{2s}(1)]
\end{align}$$
Remember that the atomic orbitals above are functions of the coordinates of the electron: $\mathrm{1s}(1) = \mathrm{1s}(\vec{r}_1) = \mathrm{1s}(r_1,\theta_1, \phi_1)$. Now, the antisymmetric spatial wavefunction has an interesting property. Let's explore what happens when the electrons get very close together, i.e. $\vec{r}_1 = \vec{r}_2 = \vec{r}$.
$$\begin{align}
\psi_\mathrm{space,antisymm} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[\mathrm{1s}(\vec{r})\mathrm{2s}(\vec{r}) - \mathrm{1s}(\vec{r})\mathrm{2s}(\vec{r})] \\
&= 0
\end{align}$$
If the wavefunction is 0 when the two electrons are on top of each other, that means that there is no probability of this happening. The average distance between the two electrons $\left\langle\left|\vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1\right|\right\rangle$ will therefore be larger, and on average the electrons will repel each other less, since they are on average further away from each other. This is known as a Fermi hole.
In fact, one can also show that the symmetric wavefunction has a larger probability amplitude when $\vec{r}_1 = \vec{r}_2$. This is known as a Fermi heap.
The total wavefunction
As I mentioned earlier, the Pauli exclusion principle dictates that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric. This means that the triplet spin wavefunctions, which are symmetric, must be paired with the antisymmetric spatial wavefunction. Likewise, the singlet spin wavefunction, which is antisymmetric, must be paired with the symmetric spatial wavefunction.
$$\begin{array}{c|c|c}
\text{Spin} & \text{Spatial} & \text{Total}\\
\hline
\text{Triplet (S)} & \text{AS} & \text{S } \times \text{ AS} = \text{AS} \\
\text{Singlet (AS)} & \text{S} & \text{AS } \times \text{ S} = \text{AS}
\end{array}$$
So, there is a decrease in electron-electron repulsion when the electrons are parallel - because this means they have a triplet spin wavefunction, and hence an antisymmetric spatial wavefunction, which has a Fermi hole.

Exchange integrals
There is another, perhaps more mathematical, way of looking at it, and that is to calculate the expectation value of the electronic energy for both wavefunctions. For the helium atom, under the assumption of an infinitely heavy nucleus (essentially an atomic version of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation), the total Hamiltonian (in atomic units) is
$$\hat{H} = -\frac{1}{2}(\nabla_1^2+\nabla_2^2) - \frac{2}{r_1} - \frac{2}{r_2} + \frac{1}{r_{12}}$$
where $r_i$ is the distance of electron $i$ from the nucleus, and $r_{12}$ is the distance between the two electrons. The expectation value of the energy is simply $\left\langle\Psi\middle|\hat{H}\middle|\Psi\right\rangle$ (assuming our wavefunction is already normalised). It turns out that the only important term in our present discussion is the electron-electron repulsion term $1/r_{12}$.
Let's look at the triplet spin wavefunction (of course paired with the antisymmetric spatial wavefunction) first. The operator doesn't depend on spin degrees of freedom, so we can separate those, and the inner product of the spin wavefunction with itself is just unity.
$$\begin{align}
\left\langle\Psi_\mathrm{triplet}\middle|\frac{1}{r_{12}}\middle|\Psi_\mathrm{triplet}\right\rangle 
&= \left\langle\psi_\mathrm{spin,triplet}\middle|\psi_\mathrm{spin,triplet}\right\rangle\left\langle\psi_\mathrm{space,antisymm}\middle|\frac{1}{r_{12}}\middle|\psi_\mathrm{space,antisymm}\right\rangle \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left\langle \mathrm{1s}(1)\mathrm{2s}(2) - \mathrm{1s}(2)\mathrm{2s}(1) \middle| \frac{1}{r_{12}} \middle| \mathrm{1s}(1)\mathrm{2s}(2) - \mathrm{1s}(2)\mathrm{2s}(1)  \right\rangle \\
&= 
\frac{1}{2} \Biggr\{ \left\langle \mathrm{1s}(1)\mathrm{2s}(2) \middle|\frac{1}{r_{12}}\middle| \mathrm{1s}(1)\mathrm{2s}(2) \right\rangle  \\
&\quad\quad\quad - \left\langle \mathrm{1s}(2)\mathrm{2s}(1) \middle|\frac{1}{r_{12}}\middle| \mathrm{1s}(1)\mathrm{2s}(2) \right\rangle \\
&\quad\quad\quad - \left\langle \mathrm{1s}(1)\mathrm{2s}(2) \middle|\frac{1}{r_{12}}\middle| \mathrm{1s}(2)\mathrm{2s}(1) \right\rangle \\
&\quad\quad\quad + \left\langle \mathrm{1s}(2)\mathrm{2s}(1) \middle|\frac{1}{r_{12}}\middle| \mathrm{1s}(2)\mathrm{2s}(1) \right\rangle\Biggr\}

Ugly, but that's what it is.
We can simplify it however by noting that the first and the fourth brackets are the same (since the variables in the integral are just dummy variables, interchanging the electron labels does not affect the value of the integral). This integral is traditionally called a Coulomb integral, since it simply reflects the average Coulombic repulsion between two independent (uncorrelated) electrons, one in the 1s orbital and the second in the 2s orbital. It is given the symbol $J_\mathrm{1s2s}$ (the subscripts indicating the orbitals that the electrons are in). Because this is an expectation value for a potential energy arising from repulsion, it is necessarily a positive quantity.
The second and third terms are actually also the same, again because the variables are just dummy variables and you can interchange the labels. This integral, however, does not have a physical interpretation; it is a purely quantum mechanical effect. It is called the exchange integral, and is given the symbol $K_\mathrm{1s2s}$. It's a bit harder to show, but the exchange integral is also a positive quantity (there is a question on it here). However, its magnitude is not as large as $J_\mathrm{1s2s}$.
Putting it all together (leaving out subscripts for clarity) we have
$$\left\langle\Psi_\mathrm{triplet}\middle|\frac{1}{r_{12}}\middle|\Psi_\mathrm{triplet}\right\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(J-K-K+J) = J-K$$
and if you were to perform the same calculation on the singlet spin wavefunction (not very difficult, just replace the minus signs with a plus!) you would get 
$$\left\langle\Psi_\mathrm{singlet}\middle|\frac{1}{r_{12}}\middle|\Psi_\mathrm{singlet}\right\rangle = \frac{1}{2}(J+K+K+J) = J+K$$
Since $J > K > 0$, the expectation value of the energy for the singlet state is higher.
But I have more than two electrons. What now?
Well, you just have to do a ton more ugly maths and perhaps a few hundred more integrals. But the idea is the same. For every pair of electrons with parallel spins, there is a corresponding exchange integral that reduces the expectation value of the energy.
Therefore, in a $\mathrm{3d^5}$ manganese atom (we ignore the closed shells) there are
$$\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10$$
different pairs of d-d electrons with parallel spins. Therefore if you evaluate the expectation value of the energy, there will be a $-10K_\mathrm{3d3d}$ term, which is stabilising. This is precisely the exchange energy effect that Geoff describes in his answer."
What is the strongest acid?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/17124/what-is-the-strongest-acid,25k,"The problem with this question is that the exact answer is ""it depends...""
First off, it depends on your definition of acidity and how you measure it. Everyone seems to be using Brønstead acids (i.e. $\ce{H+}$ donors). I see two different measures in other answers:

Proton affinity: This is a gas-phase measurement of $\ce{A^{−} + H^{+} -> HA}$
Hammett acidity ($H_0$): This is a solution measurement, given by $\mathrm pK_{\ce{BH^+}} - \log\left(\frac{[\ce{BH^+}]}{[\ce{B}]}\right)$

Secondly, it depends on medium as mentioned by LDC3.

Leveling effect: The solvent leveling effect reflects the lowest possible $\mathrm pK_\mathrm a$ in a particular solvent, based on the basicity of the conjugate base. So you need $\ce{HF}$ or fluorosulfuric acid to reach low $\mathrm pK_\mathrm a$.

So the problem in my mind is that carboranes and fluoroantimonic acid are solution measurements, but $\ce{HeH+}$ is a gas-phase measurement. It does have the highest gas-phase proton affinity. But I'd put my money on things I can use in lab.
Incidentally, the Reed group prepared the fluorinated carborane acid this year: Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53 (4), 1131–1134. So that compound, $\ce{H(CHB11F11)}$ wins the crown for strongest solution-phase Brønstead acid (for the moment, at least).
There's also a nice review article ""Myths about the Proton. The Nature of H+ in Condensed Media"" by the same group in Acc. Chem. Res. 2013, 46 (11), 2567–2575."
Why does chocolate melt so easily?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/75597/why-does-chocolate-melt-so-easily,11k,"tl;dr The main structural component of chocolate is cocoa butter, which is a blend of fatty acids (primarily oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids). Cocoa butter has multiple crystal structures, and manufacturers target a specific form which melts at around 33 °C. The fact that chocolate is about 90% sugar and cocoa butter is why chocolate is (chemically) insensitive to temperature changes.

While chocolate itself is a giant mess of hundreds of different compounds, the primary structural material of chocolate is fat. Wikipedia lists a typical composition (by mass) of about 60% sugar, 30% fats, and 10% proteins/other. So it's not terribly surprising that chocolate doesn't sublime or decompose. You probably wouldn't expect a ball of butter + sugar to suddenly decompose at 50 °C, and for the most part, chocolate is chemically pretty similar.
Now, what's interesting about cocoa butter is that it can form multiple crystal structures, and it's actually a bit tricky to get the right crystal structure out. You can read about the process in this RSC article if you'd like. The one that most chocolatiers are after is polymorph V, which is glossy and melts just below body temperature. 
However, a different polymorph, polymorph, VI is the most stable form of cocoa butter, and it has a melting point that's a bit higher. It also tends to have a faint white crust on it (known as ""fat bloom""). As a result, it's not as pleasant to look at, not as pleasant to eat (since it takes some chewing on to get it to melt), and generally undesirable.

Since form VI is the most stable, all chocolate eventually goes ""bad"" and becomes not as delicious as the maker originally intended. If you've ever bitten into an old chocolate bar and thought it was a bit waxy and unmelty, you've experienced this interconversion. I've been told by someone who did research on crystal structure kinetics that chocolate manufacturers spend lots and lots of money on research in hopes of being able to slow down or stop this process.
Now, I'd like to take stab at addressing two points in the question:

chill the molten chocolate, and you'll still get chocolate

Yes, but is it the exact same chocolate as you got before? What if you take the molten chocolate and put it in the freezer, or, heaven forbid, drop it in liquid nitrogen? Does the resulting chocolate still melt at the same temperature? My suspicion (based on this chart) is that you'll have generated some of the lower-melting cocoa forms, and thus the chocolate will get soft and melt at a much lower temperature than previously.

And why does milk chocolate (tend to) melt faster than dark chocolate (higher-cocoa content)?

I don't know. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say it's because milk chocolate tends to contain more sugar than dark chocolate, and so you're seeing some form of freezing-point depression. However, if it turns out that, at similar concentrations of sugar, milk chocolate still melts more quickly, I'd have no idea."
What is the unit of pH?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10044/what-is-the-unit-of-ph,56k,"The real definition of the $\text{pH}$ is not in terms of concentration but in terms of the activity of a proton,
\begin{equation}
  \text{pH} = - \log a_{\ce{H+}} \ ,
\end{equation}
and the activity is a dimensionless quantity. You can think of the activity as a generalization of the mole fraction that takes into account deviations from the ideal behaviour in real solutions.
By introducing the (dimensionless) activity coefficient $\gamma_{\ce{H+}}$, which represents the effect of the deviations from the ideal behaviour on the concentration, you can link the activity to the concentration via
\begin{equation}
  a_{\ce{H+}} = \frac{\gamma_{\ce{H+}} c_{\ce{H+}}}{c^0} \ ,
\end{equation}
where $c^0$ is the standard concentration of $1 \, \text{mol}/\text{L}$.
If you ignore the non-ideal contributions you can approximately express the $\text{pH}$ in terms of the normalized proton concentration
\begin{equation}
  \text{pH} \approx - \log \frac{c_{\ce{H+}}}{c^0} \ .
\end{equation}
In general, there can be no logarithm of a quantity bearing a unit. If however you encounter such a case it is usually due to sloppy notation: either the argument of the logarithm is implicitly understood to be normalized and thus becomes unitless or the units in the logarithm's argument originate from using the mathematical properties of logarithms to divide the logarithm of a product which is by itself unitless into a sum of logarithms: $\log(a \cdot b) = \log(a) + \log(b)$."
"Why does lemon juice reduce the ""fish"" odor of sea food — specifically fish?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/115219/why-does-lemon-juice-reduce-the-fish-odor-of-sea-food-specifically-fish,13k,"There are two cases, both related to acid-base reactions. Both are also partial reasons why so many fish recipes use lemon juice.
Fish, especially sea fish, naturally contain trimethylamine-N-oxide $\ce{(CH3)3N-O}$ that, after death, gets enzymatically reduced to trimethylamine $\ce{(CH3)3N}$, the source of the ammonia-like fish odour.

Trimethylamine N-oxide is an osmolyte found in saltwater fishes, sharks, rays, molluscs, and crustaceans. It is considered a protein stabilizer that may serve to counteract urea, the major osmolyte of sharks, skates and rays. It is also higher in deep-sea fishes and crustaceans, where it may counteract the protein-destabilizing effects of pressure.TMAO decomposes to trimethylamine (TMA), which is the main odorant that is characteristic of degrading seafood.
TMAO is biosynthesized from trimethylamine, which is derived from choline.

In acidic environments, TMA forms water-soluble, non-volatile, odourless trimethylammonium salts, which eliminates the volatile smelly trimethylamine.
$$\ce{(CH3)3N + H+ <=>> (CH3)3NH+ }$$
It is the direct analogy to the smelly volatile ammonia and odourless ammonium:
$$\ce{NH3 + H+ <=>> NH4+}$$

Another source of fishy smell/taste, especially of some sweet water species like carp or catfish, is geosmin, a polycyclic alcohol, being a derivate of decahydronaphthalene(decaline). It is released after the death of some Streptomyces or cyanobacteria cells which gives a muddy or earthy taste, and the human smell sensors are extremely sensitive to it (5 ppt).
Geosmin is also responsible for the smell of the soil after rain, of some beetroots and even of drinking water of surface origin. There is speculation the nose sensitivity for geosmin is an evolutionary response to the need for efficient searching for water.
Geosmin reportedly breaks down in acidic environments."
What metals aren't dissolved in/attacked by aqua regia?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/67199/what-metals-arent-dissolved-in-attacked-by-aqua-regia,39k,"Keep in mind
The answer will depend upon the reaction conditions. Most importantly,

physical state of the metal: porosity, degree of comminution;
temperature;
mechanical aggravation of metal surface during reaction.

Often times a chemistry text mentions that no reaction occurs. The reaction might still happen. It is just that for the specified parameters the process is meaningless and negligible.

Short overview of aqua regia
Aqua regia is the $3:1$ volumetric mixture of $\ce{HCl}$ and $\ce{HNO3}$. Its additional reactive power draws from monochlorine created in situ.$^{[1]\ [2]}$
$$\ce{HNO3 + 3HCl -> Cl2 + NOCl + H2O\\ NOCl -> Cl + NO}$$



Which metals are impervious to $3:1\ \ce{HCl/HNO3}$?


Almost every metal will react with aqua regia provided certain criteria are met.$^{[1]\ [2]}$ The closest you will probably get is ruthenium $\ce{Ru}$, and perhaps osmium $\ce{Os}$. To the best of my knowledge, $\ce{Ru}$ will not react with aqua regia in a meaningful way even if aqua regia is boiling.$^{[2]}$ The difference with $\ce{Os}$ is that powdered osmium is attacked by boiling aqua regia.$^{[1]\ [2]}$
$$\ce{Ru + HNO3 + HCl $\kern.6em\not\kern -.6em \longrightarrow$}$$
$$\ce{\underset{powder}{Os} + $\underbrace{\mathrm{HNO_3}}_{\text{boiling}}$ -> OsO4 + N_xO_y + H2O \\ OsO4 + 2H2O <=> H2[OsO4(OH)2] \\ OsO4 + HCl ->OsO2Cl2 + Cl2 + 2H2O\\ OsO2Cl2 + HCl ->OsCl4 + Cl2 + 2H2O\\ 2OsO2Cl2 + H2O <=> OsO2 + H2[OsO2Cl4] \\ 3OsCl4 + 2H2O <=> OsO2 + 2H2[OsCl6]\\ OsO2 + 6HCl <=> H2[OsCl6] + 2H2O}$$
Brief discussion about the list provided in the comments
Titanium $\ce{Ti}$ does react, and does so at room temperature.
$$\ce{3Ti + $\underbrace{\mathrm{12HCl + 4HNO_3}}_{\text{room temperature}}$ -> 3TiCl4 + 4NO + 8H2O}$$
Rhenium $\ce{Re}$ reacts slowly at room temperature $\ce{->HReO4}$. This will further react with $\ce{HCl -> ReCl4 + Cl2}$.$^{[2]}$
Hafnium $\ce{Hf}$ does react at room temperature. The reaction is slower than with titanium; overall equation is identical.$^{[2]}$
Tantalum $\ce{Ta}$ reacts when aqua regia is heated to $150\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Rhodium $\ce{Rh}$ reacts in a grinded state. As a large compact piece, iridium $\ce{Ir}$ is affected over temperatures of $100\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Niobium $\ce{Nb}$ is inert at room temperatures.$^{[2]}$
Summary: ruthenium $\ce{Ru}$ is your best bet.


What makes metals $\ce{Ru}$ and $\ce{Os}$ so stable in aqua regia?


The nobility of these metals is not the best explanation. As you correctly pointed out, $\ce{Pt}$ and $\ce{Au}$ react fine. This is direct evidence that for other metals a protective layer should form. The layer varies from metal to metal, but usually is either an oxide (or oxide hydrate), or a chloride.
Effectiveness of mechanical aggravation also points to stable, non-reactive compound formation on the metal's surface.
For ruthenium, as of now I am unsure what this precipitate could be. If anyone has a reference, please edit or leave a comment.$^\text{[reference needed]}$ 


What happens with silver?


Silver and aqua regia react very poorly, and for a short amount of time.$^{[2]}$ The culprit is $\ce{AgCl}$ ($K_s = 1.8 \cdot 10^{-10}$)$^{[2]}$. A slow reaction might still take place due to complexation.$^{[2]}$
Surprisingly, silver reacts with $\ce{HBr}$!$^{[2]}$ Its solubility product is even worse, $K_s = 5.0 \cdot 10^{-13}$.$^{[3]}$ My guess is that this layer is not as dense as $\ce{AgCl}$ but this still needs verifying.$^\text{[citation needed]}$

Selective nitro reduction of poly nitro compounds,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34066/selective-nitro-reduction-of-poly-nitro-compounds,20k,"Is there any way to predict which nitro group will be reduced

After having gone through three pages of Google Scholar and reading several research papers looking for an answer, there is definitely no way to predict the product here for every general case. The most detailed paper on the topic of Zinin reduction by far is Porter, H. K. Organic Reactions 2011, 455–481 (link). Even this paper went as far as to say that (p458):

It is evident that much remains to be learned about the mechanism and that studies using modern techniques and instruments would be desirable.

However, it does give reasonably detailed examples of of selective reduction of substituted dinitrobenzene which are worth mentioning. To begin with:

The positions of the substituents play an important role in the progress of the reaction. ... In polynitro compounds, the relative positions of the groups determine whether reduction gives monoamino or polyamino derivatives and determine the isomer distribution of the monoamino derivatives.

For example: (p459):

In substituted dinitro- and trinitro-benzenes, the least hindered nitro group is preferentially reduced.

In dinitro- and trinitro-phenols and their ethers, a nitro group ortho to hydroxy or alkoxy is preferentially reduced.


This is the most you need to know about this reduction. The other details are more technical, and are attached below are interested readers.

Further detailing:
In the end of the paper, Porter has provided huge tables detailing several (substituted) mono-, di-, tri-nitrobenzene derivatives and their major products on Zinin reduction. So, I studied nearly a hundred different reductions through those tables, and tried to devise other reasonable ways to predict the major product than the two already mentioned above, especially in asymmetrical polynitrobenzene derivatives. I've not listed below mononitrobenzenes since they have only a single nitro group to be reduced. Further, symmetrical polynitrobenzenes (like 2,4,6-trinitromesitylene) have all their nitro groups equivalent, so the product obtained on reduction of either group is same. I've ignored biphenyls and napthalenes in my calculations to keep results simple. Further, exceptional products are not listed here, as they have already been detailed in the paper (p460-p464 under ""Side reactions"").
The following findings may be used to predict the major product in simple polynitrobenzene derivatives. Keep in mind that exceptional side-reactions do occur, so the prediction may not always be accurate. Yet, a substantially large list of predictable products is obtained as shown below. Examples of compounds are enclosed in parentheses.

The less sterically hindered $\ce{-NO2}$ is reduced in alkyl derivatives of polytnitrobenzene (tables 2 and 3).
Example: 5-t-butyl-2,4,6-trinitro-m-xylene yields 4-t-butyl-3,5-dinitro-2,6-xylidene i.e. a fancy way to say that the $\ce{-NO2}$ group para to the tert-butyl group got reduced.
When a hydroxy or alkoxy group is present, then the ortho nitro group is reduced, even in presence of other halogens on the ring.
(table 4: 2,4-dinitrophenol, 2-chloro-4,6-dinitrophenol, 4-bromo-2,6-dinitrophenol)
If both an alkyl substituent and a hydroxy/alkoxy group are present, and: (table 4)


a single nitro group is ortho to the hydroxy/alkoxy, then that ortho nitro group is reduced
(2,4-dinitroanisole, 2,4-dinitrophenetole, 2,3-dimethoxy-5,6-dinitrotoluene)
no nitro group is ortho/both nitro groups are ortho to the hydroxy/alkoxy group, then the least sterically nitro group hindered is reduced
(2,3-dimethoxy-5,6-dinitrotoluene; 1,2,4-trimethoxy-5,6-dinitrobenzene yields 3,4,6-trimethoxy-2-nitroaniline)

Table 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 do not have any analyseable compounds.
Table 9 lists nitro derivatives of aniline. 


preference in reduction is given to the nitro group ortho to the amino group.
(2,4-dinitroaniline, 2,6-dinitroaniline, 3,5-dinitroaniline)
even in presence of other alkoxy or alkyl substituents, the nitro group ortho to the amino group is only reduced.
(4,6-dinitro-o-toluidine, 4,6-dinitro-o-anisidine, 4,6-dinitro-2,5-xylidene)
the ortho nitro group is reduced even in case of N-alkyl anilines, though they are much more bulky.
(N-ethyl-2,4-dinitroaniline, N-methyl-2,4-dinitroaniline)



There are a few cases which I was unable to resolve. The author has not noted them as an exception either. Suggestions are welcome:

Table 4 states that 2,4-dinitroanisole yields 5-nitro-o-anisidine. It is not entirely clear to me why the expected 4-nitro-o-anisidine was not formed. The same yield is observed in 2,4-dinitrophenetole yieldings 5-nitro-o-phenetidine.
Table 7 gives the reduction of 2,4-dinitro-$\alpha$-toluenesulfonic acid as 2-amino-4-nitro-$\alpha$-toluenesulfonic acid, which is not clear why, given the steric constraints at the ortho position.
Table 9 states reduction of 3,5-dinitro-2,4-xylidene gives 2,4-dimethyl-5-nitro-m-phenylenediamine. It is not clear to me why the more sterically hindered nitro group is reduced. It isn't even ortho to the aniline group.


I believe this is a reasonably detailed analysis of the selective reduction of the polynitro compounds."
Why does the 3rd electron shell start filling up with scandium?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/8357/why-does-the-3rd-electron-shell-start-filling-up-with-scandium,35k,"The relative energies of the electronic subshells have been calculated for atoms in the vicinity of $Z=20$ (J. Chem. Educ., 1994, 71 (6), 469), and the result is surprising:

Looking at this graph, by all means the electronic configuration of scandium should in fact be $\ce{1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6}$ $\color{blue}{\ce{3d^3}}$ in order to minimize orbital energies! The graph does not show the energy of the $\ce{4p}$ subshell, but it would lie somewhat above both curves shown. However, there is an important effect not being considered here, which is the destabilizing interelectronic repulsions. Electrons in a same subshell tend to repel each other more (intrasubshell repulsion) than electrons in different subshells (intersubshell repulsion). It turns out (and no one can really qualitatively explain why, see below) the repulsion is such that in an atom with $Z=21$, the configuration $\ce{[Ar] 4s^2 3d^1}$ is lower in energy than other potential candidates, such as $\ce{[Ar] 3d^3}$ or $\ce{[Ar] 4s^1 3d^2}$. Theoretically, the odd configurations $\ce{[Ar] 4s^2 4p^1}$ or $\ce{[Ar] 4s^1 3d^1 4p^1}$ would have lower interelectron repulsion energies than the observed ground state, but in these cases the lowered interelectron repulsions do not compensate the requirement of populating the higher-energy $\ce{4p}$ subshell. The comparison of several possible electron configurations and the joint minimization of orbital energy and electron repulsion energies does not seem to be something that can be done without resorting to heavy calculations or direct experimental validation.
In addition to some material I linked in comments, this article from Eric Scerri's blog (a chemist who focuses on aspects of periodicity, including electronic distribution) states, regarding the electronic configuration of scandium compared to calcium and to the $\ce{Sc^3+}$ ion (emphasis mine):

This amounts to saying that all three of the final electrons enter $\ce{3d}$ but two of them are repelled into an energetically less favourable orbital, the $\ce{4s}$, because the overall result is more advantageous for the atom as a whole.  But this is not something that can be predicted.  Why is it 2 electrons, rather than one or even none?  In cases like chromium and copper just one electron is pushed into the $\ce{4s}$ orbital.  In an analogous case from the second transition series, the palladium atom, the competition occurs between the $\ce{5s}$ and $\ce{4d}$ orbitals. In this case none of the electrons are pushed up into the $\ce{5s}$ orbital and the resulting configuration has an outer shell of $\ce{[Kr] 4d^10}$.
None of this can be predicted in simple terms from a rule of thumb and so it seems almost worth masking this fact by claiming that the overall configuration can be predicted, at least as far as the cases in which two electrons are pushed up into the relevant s orbital.  To those who like to present a rather triumphal image of science it is too much to admit that we cannot make these predictions. The use of the sloppy Aufbau seems to avoid this problem since it gives the correct overall configuration and hardly anybody smells a rat.

So unfortunately, it seems that even though most of the effects which combine to result in the observed electronic configurations are known, there is no qualitative way to predict where the configurations are going to mismatch with the Aufbau principle or the energy levels of the orbitals. I have read the statement that the Aufbau principle is most decidedly wrong for practically every atom with respect to the placement of the orbital energy levels, but incredibly it happens to predict the configuration of the valence shell for most atoms."
Electrical conductivity of graphite,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/820/electrical-conductivity-of-graphite,22k,"Good catch - you are absolutely correct. This is a mistake in the Wikipedia page, as a quick check with the reference listed there confirms. The values are the wrong way around.
Changing it now...
Edited to add: this of course raises the question of why it should be this way around. A somewhat hand-wavy answer is that, just like in benzene, the $p_z$ orbitals overlap within each graphene sheet so that the electron contributed by each carbon is delocalised in this plane (the other three are bound up in the three $\sigma$ bonds). So in a sense this is conjugation, but over a whole 2D plane rather than around a ring or along a single chain of atoms. On the other hand, the graphene sheets are rather further apart from one another than the covalently bonded atoms within a sheet (as you might expect since the sheets are only weakly bound through van der Waals interactions), and so the overlap is greatly reduced and conduction is much more difficult.
A more complete answer would rely on a study of graphite's electronic band structure, which is an active research area and beyond the scope of this response!"
"Why are tertiary carbocations the most reactive, if they're already stable?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/30893/why-are-tertiary-carbocations-the-most-reactive-if-theyre-already-stable,65k,"This is an excellent question. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is what you are grasping at:
First, it is true that tertiary carbocations are generally more stable than primary carbocations (and secondary carbocations) due to having more inductively donating alkyl groups. The hyperconjugative effect can also be invoked to explain the relative stabilities of primary, secondary, and tertiary carbocations. 
Second, transition states involving tertiary carbocations as opposed to primary carbocations are more favorable precisely because tertiary carbocations are more stable than primary carbocations. 
Note that this does not mean that tertiary carbocations are more reactive. We don't generally say that something which exists in a transition state is reactive/unreactive. One reason is that the transition state complex cannot be directly captured or observed. Another reason is that it is the transition state ... of course it's going to be reactive - of course it'll change very rapidly! 
We may however say that reactants and products are either reactive or unreactive. So if something goes through a transition state involving a tertiary carbocation, it might well be more reactive than something which goes through a transition state involving a primary carbocation. 
Of course, before labeling anything as reactive or unreactive, you'd do well to note exactly what you mean by reactivity. To put it lightly, there are myriad reactions. An alkyne such as acetylene is reactive with regard to combustion; acetylene torches are commonplace. However, acetylene isn't going to be reactive with regard to, say, backside attack (for a variety of reasons). 
Ultimately I think your issue lies with semantics rather than the chemistry ... still, a good question!"
Why are DCM and chloroform so resistant towards nucleophilic substitution?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15690/why-are-dcm-and-chloroform-so-resistant-towards-nucleophilic-substitution,14k,"Introduction (and Abstract, TLDR)
In very short words you can say, that the anomeric effect is responsible for the lack of reactiveness. The electronic effect may very well be compensating for the the steric effect, that could come from the methyl moiety. In any way, most of the steric effects can often been seen as electronic effects in disguise.
Analysis of Molecular Orbitals
I will analyse the bonding picture based on calculations at the density fitted density functional level of theory, with a fairly large basis set: DF-BP86/def2-TZVPP. As model compounds I have chosen chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform and chloroethane.
First of all let me state, that the bond lengths are a little larger at this level, however, the general trend for shortening can also be observed. In this sense, chloroethane behaves like chloromethane. An attempt to explain this will be given at the end of this article.
\begin{array}{lr}\hline
\text{Compound} & \mathbf{d}(\ce{C-Cl})\\\hline
\ce{ClCH3}      &  1.797\\
\ce{Cl2CH2}     &  1.786\\
\ce{Cl3CH}      &  1.783\\\hline
\ce{ClCH2CH3}   &  1.797\\\hline
\end{array}
In the canonical bonding picture, it is fairly obvious, that the electronic effects dominate and are responsible for the lack of reactivity. In other words, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is very well delocalised in the dichloromethane and chloroform case. This is effectively leaving no angle to attack the antibonding orbitals.

In the  mono substituted cases there is a large coefficient at the carbon, where a nucleophile can readily attack.
One can also analyse the bonding situation in terms of localised orbitals. Here I make use of a Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis, that transforms the canonical orbitals into hybrid orbitals, which all have an occupation of about two electrons. Due to the nature of the approach, it is no longer possible to speak of HOMO or LUMO, when analysing the orbitals. Due to the nature of the calculations, i.e. there are polarisation functions, the values do not necessarily add up to 100%. The deviation is so small, that it can be omitted.

As we go from mono- to di- to trisubstituted methane, the carbon contribution increases slightly, along with the percentage of $s$ character. More $s$ character usually means also a stronger bond, which often results in a shorter bond distance. Of course, delocalization will have a similar effect on its own.
The reason, why dichloromethane and chloroform are fairly unreactive versus nucleophiles, has already been pointed out in terms of localised bonding. But we can have a look at these orbitals as well.
In the case of chloromethane, the LUMO has more or less the same scope of the canonical orbital, with the highest contribution from the carbon. If we compare this antibonding orbital to an analogous orbital in dichloromethane or chloroform, we can expect the same form. We soon run into trouble, because of the localised $p$ lone pairs of chlorine. Not necessarily overlapping, but certainly in the way of the ""backside"" of the bonding orbital. In the case of chloroethane we can observe hyperconjugation. However, this effect is probably less strong, and from the canonical bonding picture we could also assume, that this increases the polarisation of the antibonding orbital in favour of carbon.
In the following pictures, occupied orbitals are coloured red and yellow, while virtual orbitals are coloured purple and orange.

(Note that in chloroform two lone pair orbitals are shown.) 
Conclusion
Even though this article does not use the Valence Bond Approach, one can clearly see the qualitative manifestation of Bent's Rule (compare also: Utility of Bent's Rule - What can Bent's rule explain that other qualitative considerations cannot?). A higher $s$ character means a shorter bond. The lack of reactivity towards nucleophiles can be explained electronically with a delocalised LUMO. In terms of localised bonding, the lone pairs of any additional chlorine atom would provide sufficient electron density, to shield the backside attack on the carbon."
Why are covalent bonds directional?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34550/why-are-covalent-bonds-directional,65k,"The meaning of covalent bonds being directional is that atoms bonded covalently prefer specific orientations in space relative to one another. As a result, molecules in which atoms are bonded covalently have definite shapes. 
The reason for this directionality is that covalent bonds are formed by sharing electrons between atoms, or, in other words, as you said, by overlapping the atomic orbitals of participant atoms. And usually only few patterns of overlap are possible, consequently, only few spatial arrangements of atoms are possible.
Ionic bonds are different: there is no electron sharing (or atomic orbital overlaps) and the number of anions surrounding a cation is limited by the charges of the ions, their sizes, and the efficiency of the lattice packing."
What are oxidation states used for?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/61040/what-are-oxidation-states-used-for,11k,"Of course they are useful. Perhaps you have not come across them yet, but being able to determine the oxidation state of an atom allows us to understand the properties of chemicals and how redox reactions work.
Let's just give two very simple examples. There are tons more. (I don't even want to go into organometallic chemistry, where being able to determine the oxidation state is incredibly important.)

Potassium permanganate, $\ce{KMnO4}$, has manganese in a +7 oxidation state. This means that it would have an electronic configuration identical to the noble gas argon: $\mathrm{1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6}$, and therefore its $\mathrm{3d}$ orbitals are empty.
Now, most transition metal compounds are said to be coloured because of so-called ""d-d* transitions"". However, this can only occur if the d orbitals are partially filled - if there are no electrons in the d orbitals, like in $\ce{KMnO4}$, then there are no d-d* transitions available.
As such, the intense purple colour of $\ce{KMnO4}$ has to be explained via a different mechanism. In this case, it is explained by ligand-metal charge transfer.

Moving to organic chemistry. Let's say you have an acyl chloride, $\ce{RCOCl}$, and you want to convert it to an aldehyde, $\ce{RCHO}$. If you calculate the respective oxidation states of the carbonyl carbons, you get +3 and +1 respectively.
So, that tells you what kind of reagent you need to effect this transformation: you need a reducing agent. Hydrogen gas, $\ce{H2}$, is one such example of a reducing agent. Why? Well, that's because of oxidation states again. $\ce{H2}$ has hydrogen in an oxidation state of 0, and when hydrogen forms a bond to carbon, it has an oxidation state of +1.
Oxidation states are key to understanding why redox reactions work and why certain species are reducing agents (e.g. $\ce{LiAlH4}$: H(-1)) and why others are oxidising agents (e.g. DMSO, $\ce{(CH3)2SO}$, in the Swern oxidation)."
What is the difference between dynamic and static electronic correlation,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/59549/what-is-the-difference-between-dynamic-and-static-electronic-correlation,14k,"$\newcommand{\el}{_\mathrm{e}}$In quantum chemistry, when a nomenclature in which one distinguishes between ""static"" and ""dynamic"" correlation is used, ""correlation"" referrers to all the deficiencies of the Hartree-Fock (HF) single-determinantal approach. For instance, the the correlation energy is defined as the difference between the exact (non-relativistic) energy and the HF energy (calculated with a complete basis),
$$
  E_{\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\mathrm{exact}} - E_{\mathrm{HF}} \, .
$$
Now, what are the deficiencies of a Hartree-Fock approach?

First, electrons in this model do not instantaneously interact with each other, as they do in reality, but rather each and every electron interacts with the average, or mean, field created by all other electrons. Classically speaking, each electron moves in a way so that it avoids locations in a close proximity to the instantaneous positions of all other electrons. And the failure of the HF model to correctly reproduce such motion of electrons is the first source of $E_{\mathrm{corr}}$. This type of correlation is called dynamic correlation since it is directly related to electron dynamics. 
Secondly, the wave function in the HF model is a single Slater determinant, which might be a rather poor representation of a many-electron system's state: in certain cases an electronic state can be well described only by a linear combination of more than one (nearly-)degenerate Slater determinants. This is the second reason why $E_{\mathrm{HF}}$ may differ from $E_{\mathrm{exact}}$ and the corresponding type of correlation is called static, or nondynamic, since it ist not related to electron dynamics.

Interestingly, both static and dynamic correlation effects can be taken into account by ""mixing in"" more Slater determinants $\Phi_i$ to the Hartree-Fock one $\Phi_0$,
$$
  \Psi\el(\vec{r}\el) = c_0 \Phi_0 + \sum_i c_i \Phi_i \, ,
$$
Here, if $c_0$ is assumed to be close to $1$ and a large number of excited determinants $\Phi_i$ are added each of which is assumed to give only a small contribution, then the method primarily treats dynamic correlation. And if, on the other hand, it is assumed that there are just a few excited determinants $\Phi_i$ with weights close to that of the reference determinant $\Phi_0$, then the method primarily treats static correlation.
An example of a method that recovers primarily dynamic correlation is Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP$n$), while multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) method primarily takes account of static correlation. Note the word ""primarily"" here and above. It is almost impossible in principle to keep dynamic and static correlation effects separated since they both arise from the very same physical interaction. Thus, methods that typically cover dynamical correlation effects include at high-order also some of the non-dynamical correlation effects and vice versa."
Why do salts such as NaCl dissolve?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5915/why-do-salts-such-as-nacl-dissolve,30k,"As it happens, the enthalpy of solution of $\ce{NaCl}$ in water (that is, the energy change associated with the dissolution of sodium chloride crystals in water) at standard conditions is very slightly positive, i.e., it is an endothermic process. At a constant temperature and pressure, these kinds of thermodynamic processes are dictated by the change in Gibbs free energy, described by the equation
$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S
$$
Where $\Delta G < 0$ is a necessary criterion for a spontaneous process. Given that $\Delta H$ is positive, $\Delta S$ must be positive as well, otherwise the process wouldn't occur spontaneously (which is to say, not without input of work from the surroundings, or coupling to some other strongly favorable reaction, neither of which is the case for the dissolution of salt). In other words, this is a process that is driven by the increase in entropy, which is entirely to be expected when moving from a highly ordered state (i.e., a crystalline solid) to a less ordered liquid solution. Indeed, in ideal solutions, where intermolecular forces of attraction are taken to be equal between all components, enthalpy change is necessarily zero, and entropy is always positive, so that the process of mixing in ideal solutions is always spontaneous. Of course, in real solutions, this is not the case.
Your intuition that the Coulombic forces between ions should be stronger is correct in this particular instance, as indicated by the positive enthalpy (meaning, the breaking of ionic bonds in the crystal lattice, as well as intermolecular bonds between solvent molecules, requires more energy than is released in the forming of ion-dipole bonds). The input of energy required for this process comes in the form of heat, drawn from the solvent. However, there are numerous examples of salts for which the enthalpy of solution is negative under a wide range of conditions.
The statement ""[l]ook at salt crystals: they don't have any force of attraction between them"" is inaccurate, though. In fact, there is strong ionic bonding. The very fact that the crystals remain solid except at very high temperatures is sufficient evidence of this, and the strength of the bonding in the crystal lattice can be quantified by calculating the lattice energy. It's a mistake to consider any substance in isolation. When you talk about ""cutting"" $\ce{NaCl}$, what you're talking about is applying physical force to the crystals, exposing them to the complex mixtures of gasses and mositure in the air, and bringing them in contact with, say, the metal in the knife. If left in relative isolation, the salt remains undisturbed, packed in a crystal lattice. A gas, however, which has weak forces of attraction between individual particles, will expand to fill a container without any work being done to it (at least as far as atmospheric pressure allows). A liquid will experience capillary forces, either climbing the walls of a narrow container, resulting in a concavity at its surface, or pooling away from the walls of the container, resulting in a convexity at its surface (which of the two happens depends mainly on the comparative strengths of the forces of attraction between the molecules of the liquid and those of the substance comprising the container)."
Is activated carbon classified as organic or inorganic?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/18/is-activated-carbon-classified-as-organic-or-inorganic,10k,"While nomenclature is of particular interest to organic chemists to specify an exact compound, the classification of X into broad category Y or Z isn't a precise science, and not really of practical use.  The article cites a textbook by Seager to this effect, stating 

The distinction between ""organic"" and ""inorganic"" carbon compounds, while ""useful in organizing the vast subject of chemistry... is somewhat arbitrary""

Even if you find a source that says ""charcoal is (in)organic"", you may just as well find one stating the opposite.  Just like the coal from which it may have been produced, it was once biomass and decidedly organic, but so was graphite and diamond, or CO2 and CO32−. I think it's overly pedantic and unproductive to try to come up with definitive judgements for these decidedly edge case scenarios.
After all, it's just a chemical on the shelf, what one does with it is far more relevant.  I don't use it on a daily basis, but it seems more like a tool than a reagent.  The fact it contains carbon seems beside the point; it's value isn't in the chemical composition but rather its extraordinary adsorptive properties."
Why are noble gases stable,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/7520/why-are-noble-gases-stable,15k,"Actually it is not necessary to dig deep into quantum mechanics. There are several reasons why noble gasses are stable (as gasses at room temperature).
First of all, there is the obvious full valence shell. 
Trend in the periodic table make clear that the charge of the nucleus grows from left to right in every period. The attractive force towards the electrons therefore increases. (This holds also from top to bottom.) Electrons in lower orbitals ($n<\text{period}$) now shield the charge of the nucleus. This will be somewhat the same throughout the period. (The orbitals also shrink due to higher charge of the nucleus.) In noble gasses the valence shell is completely filled, providing quite a good shield for the next shell. Also the increase in the main quantum number means a significant increase in the energy level of the next orbital. This makes it unlikely, that a noble gas will accept another electron.
Due to the high charge of the nucleus it is also not easy to remove an electron from an orbital. However, this is possible from (at least) Argon on downwards. For example: $\ce{HArF}$ is stable in a matrix at room temperature. It has a strong covalent $\sigma$ bond ($\ce{H\bond{-}Ar+}$) and a not quite as strong ionic bond ($\ce{[HAr]+\cdots F-}$). Krypton already does some fancy chemistry, that is stable at room temperature. As Uncle Al has pointed out Xenon is well known for its reactivity. 
But why the sudden change? It is fairly intuitive, that the maximum electron density for each orbital with increasing main quantum number is also further away from the nucleus. That makes the valence shell very well polarizeable. Also the electrons are better shielded by the previous shells. However, the natural occurrence of these elements are as (homonuclear) gasses.
However, if you bring these elements in close contact with each other it was found out, that they have a very small dissociation energy ($D_e<1~\text{meV}$). This is due to dispersion, and van-der-Waals Forces, which is the main interaction between these elements. However, in $\ce{He2}$ no binding mode was observed (instant dissociation).
But that still does not answer, why those elements are stable as gasses, as pointed out that there are in fact attractive forces. The reason is as simple as obvious: Entropy. If two noble gasses would form a molecule/adduct, the bond/association energy of this molecule would have to compensate for the loss of entropy (Two volume elements would become one, hence the gas would have to expand to cover the room previously occupied, which requires work energy).
The explanation by tschoppi also covers, why from a MO point of view there could not be a bond in $\ce{He2}$. Go ahead and ask yourself the question if this would be true for $\ce{He3}$. We also know that orbital overlap is only one component to the truth. There are many other more. If it was not for such a nice thing like dispersion and other weak chemical interactions we would not exist."
"Why do atoms ""want"" to have a full outer shell?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/16922/why-do-atoms-want-to-have-a-full-outer-shell,42k,"You are attaching too much importance to Lewis structures. The 8-electron rule and Lewis structures which are derived from it are only rough guidelines for working out the electronic structure of a compound in very broad strokes. Often these broad strokes are accurate enough to make some meaningful statements about molecular properties but it does not accurately describe the true electron or charge distribution in a compound. Take water for example. As you say, the 8-electron rule would predict that the hydrogen atoms each transfer one electron to the oxygen molecule which would then carry a charge of -2. But experiments show a different result: here you can find a paper that determined 

that a charge of approximately $0.5 e$ is transferred from each
  hydrogen atom to the oxygen

which would amount to a partial charge of $-1 e$ on oxygen and here you can find a similar claim:

The charge distribution depends significantly on the atomic geometry and the method for its calculation but is likely to be about
  $-0.7e$ on the O-atom (with the equal but opposite positive charge equally divided between the H-atoms) for the isolated molecule.

And there not being a $-2e$ charge on oxygen is quite understandable if you look at the electron affinities of oxygen (e.g. here): You see that the first electron affinity is $-142 \, \mathrm{kJ}/\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ and thus energy is gained by the process of transferring a free electron to a neutral oxygen atom. But the second electron affinity is $+844 \, \mathrm{kJ}/\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, so another electron transfer is very costly. The quite extreme situation of a -2-charged oxygen described by the 8-electron rule is very rarely found in real compounds. Even in ionic compounds like $\ce{NaCl}$ the electron is not 100% completely transfered from the electropositive to the electronegative element."
"Which carbocation is more stable, the ethyl- or 1-propyl-carbocation?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/29000/which-carbocation-is-more-stable-the-ethyl-or-1-propyl-carbocation,19k,"The ethyl carbocation ($\ce{C2H5+}$) has a different structure than what you might have anticipated.  It is a non-classical ion with a bridging hydrogen.
For a description of just what a non-classical carbocation is see this answer. 
The hallmark of a non-classical ion is 3 atoms with 2 electrons spread over them.  This is called a 3-center 2-electron bond (hypercoordinate bonding). In the case at hand the 3-atom 2-electron bond involves the 2 carbon atoms and the bridged hydrogen atom.

So there is no ""methyl"" group present in the ethyl carbocation that can inductively release electrons.  Additionally, the hyperconjugated resonance structure you mentioned has actually been replaced by a hydrogen that is partially bonded to the other carbon atom.
The n-propyl carbocation would likely have a similar non-classical structure - if it existed at all.  This carbocation has not been experimentally observed, it rearranges too rapidly to the much more stable 2-propyl carbocation.
So while we can't answer your question about whether inductive or hyperconjugative effects are more important in this series of compounds, we can assess which cation is more stable.
A variety of experiments suggest that the heat of formation of the non-classical ethyl cation is around 215 kcal/mol (reference, see pp. 68-72). This same reference points out that the heat of formation of the classical 1-propyl cation lies approximately 20 kcal/mol above that of the 2-propyl cation.  The heat of formation of the 2-propyl cation is around 193 kcal/mol.  Adding 20 kcal/mol to that value would place the classical 1-propyl cation around 213 kcal/mol. But, assuming the 1-propyl cation would also be a non-classical ion it would be lower in energy than the classical version, its heat of formation would therefore be less than 213 kcal/mol.
This analysis suggests that the 1-propyl cation would likely have a lower heat of formation than the ethyl cation.  In other words, the 1-propyl cation would likely be more stable than the ethyl cation."
Difference in the functioning of alkaline and acidified KMnO4,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/9001/difference-in-the-functioning-of-alkaline-and-acidified-kmno4,53k,"Permanganate as oxidizing agent works most efficiently in acidic solution, because it is reduced to the greatest extent in this medium, from oxidation state +VII in $\ce{MnO4-}$ to +II in $\ce{Mn^2+}$. 
$$\ce{8H+ + MnO4- + 5e- ->~ Mn^2+ + 4H2O}$$
Therefore, the number of electrons transferred from oxidized species per mole $\ce{KMnO4}$ (5 electrons) is the largest, and the least amount of $\ce{KMnO4}$ is needed for the reaction with a certain amount of alcohol. This makes oxidation in acidic medium the best choice for economic reasons.
The oxidation in neutral medium is less efficient, as manganese(VII) is only reduced to manganese(IV), yielding insoluble $\ce{MnO2}$ as a byproduct which needs to be removed from the reaction mixture during purification of the desired product (carboxylic acid).
$$\ce{2H2O + MnO4- + 3e- ->~ MnO2\downarrow + 4OH-}$$
Oxidation in strongly alkaline medium is least efficient in terms of transferred electrons per mole permanganate, as the latter is only reduced to manganate(VI).
$$\ce{MnO4- +e- ->~ MnO4^2-}$$
However, when the reaction is done under these conditions, a higher reaction speed and selectivity can be achieved, presumably because the alcohol will react more readily with $\ce{MnO4-}$ when deprotonated. Nevertheless, oxidation in acidic medium can be preferred for reasons stated above and substrates which are sensitive to strong bases."
"Microwaving a glass of water, what happens?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/63587/microwaving-a-glass-of-water-what-happens,26k,"Heating water on a hot plate is safe, because the hottest point is at the bottom of the pot. A lot of relatively small bubbles appear there without much overheating of the water, because there is a lot of nucleation at the uneven phase boundary steel-water.
In a microwave, the hottest place is IN the water. The glass does not get heated by microwave (at least not much), and radiates off some heat to the surrounding.
Problem: In clean water, there are few good nucleation points to form bubbles, only some dust particles perhaps. So the water gets overheated rather strongly, and a first bubble that appears can grow a lot before it has cooled its surroundings down to 100 °C. That one huge bubble can throw most of the water out of the glass. It boils over, violently.
Btw. a microwave does not heat its content uniformly. It forms a standing electromagnetic wave (that's not radiation, strictly speaking) in the oven, like a rope swung quickly between two people, or a guitar string. The wave pattern has knots at a distance of $0.5c/f\approx6\ \mathrm{cm}$ (with $f=2.45\ \mathrm{GHz}$ and speed of light $c$ which of course is a bit less in your chicken), where there is very little heating. That's why the microwave oven has the rotating plate, to generate some uniform heating. For pure water, that doesn't matter, because convection sets in anyway and distributes the heat."
How do you separate enantiomers?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/153/how-do-you-separate-enantiomers,67k,"There are several ways that enantiomers can be separated, but none of them are particularly simple.
The first way to separate them is chiral chromatography.  In chiral chromatography, silica gel is bonded to chiral molecules to form what is called a chiral stationary phase.  The enantiomers will then separate as they run down the column because one of the enantiomers will interact more strongly with the column and ""stick"" in place.  Chiral sugars (ex. cellulose) are frequently used in chiral chromatography.
The second common method is to react the enantiomers with another chemical to form diastereomers.  While enantiomers are identical in terms of chemical properties, diastereomers are not.  Diastereomers can be created by reacting a mixture of both the enantiomers with another chiral molecule, such as s-brucine, which is commonly used because it is cheap.  Diastereomers have different chemical properties (for example melting points), so it is much easier to separate them.  Then, after separation, the enantiomers can be recovered from the single diastereomer."
What happens to gunpowder when it gets wet?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/74466/what-happens-to-gunpowder-when-it-gets-wet,33k,"In general, putting explosives in water will not prevent them from exploding, because most explosives already contain all of the necessary reactants to produce an explosive chemical reaction.  They do not need to draw oxygen from the air, and the reaction happens much too fast for the water to act as a heat sink.
Traditional ""black powder"" is an exception; it doesn't explode when wet.  I don't know exactly why this is, but two plausible reasons are:

Unlike most other explosives, black powder is shock-insensitive; it has to be initiated with a flame or spark.  Water can easily soak up all the heat energy from a small flame, like the one you get from a percussion cap.  This is the same as how it's harder to set fire to a living tree than a dry log, but if the fire gets hot enough it will still catch.
Black powder is a ""low"" explosive, meaning that the chemical reaction happens relatively slowly (for an explosion), which gives the water more time to absorb heat energy and quench the reaction.

Worse, black powder can be permanently ruined by water.  This is because it's a mixture of saltpeter (potassium nitrate, $\ce{KNO3}$), sulfur, and charcoal, and saltpeter is water-soluble.  If you get it wet enough, the saltpeter can be completely washed out of the mixture.  This doesn't always happen; the 19th century industrial manufacturing process for black powder involved deliberately dampening it, both to make it less dangerous during manufacture, and to make saltpeter crystals form inside each particle of charcoal.  But they were careful to use only just enough water."
Is alcohol really a solution?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/44341/is-alcohol-really-a-solution,89k,"Technically, alcohol is the name of a class of organic compounds containing one or several hydroxyl groups.
Colloquially, the term ""alcohol"" is understood as you have described: A solution (of varying degree of purity) of ethanol and water. Pure ethanol is impossible to create via the traditional method of purification (atmospheric distillation) as the water-ethanol mixture is azeotropic:¹

An azeotrope [...] is a mixture of two or more liquids whose proportions cannot be altered by simple distillation. This happens because, when an azeotrope is boiled, the vapour has the same proportions of constituents as the unboiled mixture.
Source: Wikipedia

This is why a chemist would never think ""100% pure ethanol"" when you mention ""alcohol"".
If you check for example this vendor page for the purest ethanol (>99.5%) I could find, you see various substances listed as impurities:

<0.2% Water
<0.1% Methanol
Other organic substances, such as isopropanol and acetone

Concerning your second question, I would argue that many distilled spirits (vodka, whisky, and cognac just to name a few) are solutions of ethanol, water, and various flavour compounds. 
Some alcoholic beverages, such as unfiltered beer and wine, usually also contain solid particles and would as such be correctly termed ""suspensions"".

¹ I wonder now whether it would be possible to produce 100% ethanol from another mixture somehow. The problem is probably that every common starting mixture already has some amount of water. But synthesizing ethanol in, say, an ionic liquid under an inert atmosphere and then distilling it away might be an interesting approach."

Melting and boiling points of transition elements,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/4766/melting-and-boiling-points-of-transition-elements,79k,"I don't really like parts of this explanation (was hoping to find a better one here actually), but it's the best I know. I'll build on suggestions by @michielim and @vrtcl1dvoshun.
(Note: I think most of this argument can be transposed to the orbital overlap picture of bonding, but it might be slightly trickier to describe.)


For a backdrop to this answer, I have plotted the melting points and boiling points of the transition metals, so make sure to stare at these for a while before reading on.
From the physicists' ""electron sea"" point of view of metal bonding, the higher the ionic charge the metal atom can support, the higher the element's melting and boiling points. This explains why group 1 metals such as sodium have quite low melting/boiling points since the metal would be composed of electrons delocalized in a $\ce{M}^+$ lattice. Going towards group 2 and group 3 elements, one can expect to find a $\ce{M}^{2+}$ and $\ce{M}^{3+}$ lattice, and so on. However, this does not mean that, for example, metallic osmium is expected to be made out of $\ce{Os}^{8+}$ cations surrounded by a dense electron sea; as each successive ""ionization"" of the metal atom is performed, it becomes more unlikely that the next electron can become delocalized since it has to fight against a higher effective nuclear charge relative to the electron before it. Therefore, we can expect some ""optimal average charge"" for the metal ions in the pure metal. Since melting and boiling points tend to increase towards groups 7 and 8, we can safely assume that this optimal average charge is at least greater than $+3$, and it is likely higher for the heavier elements since they have significantly higher melting/boiling points.
If we can somehow figure out how easily electrons can be removed from their parent atoms to create the electron sea, we may have an argument to explain the trends and apparent discontinuities. First, notice that the $4^{\ce{th}}$ period metals are in general a little bit underwhelming compared to their $5^{\ce{th}}$ and 6$^{\ce{th}}$ period counterparts when looking at the boiling points. This can be attributed to the fact that the $3d$ orbitals are anomalously compact relative to higher $nd$ orbitals. This happens because all first occurrences of a given sublevel (i.e. $1s$, $2p$, $3d$, $4f$, $5g$, etc.) are composed of orbitals whose wavefunctions have no radial node. Since the wavefunction's value is monotonically increasing up to its maximum value, it tapers off quickly. Thus, when a 4$^{\ce{th}}$ period metal atom tries to delocalize its $3d$ electrons, it meets a slight increase in resistance due to its stronger interaction with the nucleus, meaning that the optimal average charge of the ions is slightly lower and leading to lesser interatomic interactions holding the metal together.
Now, for the sudden dips, most visible for $\ce{Cr,\, Mn}$ and $\ce{Tc}.$ As has been suggested, one is tempted to take into consideration the fact that they all have $d^5$ configurations, which represent a half-filled $d$ subshell. It can be argued that they are particularly stable due to exchange energy, though Cann suggests it is not the most adequate explanation and instead forwards the ""parallel spin avoidance factor"".
In half-filled subshell configurations, there is a maximum in the effective nuclear charge felt by the electrons (compared to the previous elements with no doubly-occupied orbitals) combined with relatively low interorbital repulsions due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The element that follows a half-filled subshell must now put an electron in a previously occupied orbital, creating stronger, intraorbital electron repulsion. These effects combine to suggest that removing an electron from or forcing an electron into half-filled configurations is particularly difficult (notice that $\ce{Cr}$ doesn't follow $\ce{Mn}$ and $\ce{Tc},$ more on that soon). If this is the case, then the delocalization of the third electron (which would create $\ce{Mn}^{3+}$ and $\ce{Tc}^{3+}$ ions) and all those beyond it would be somewhat suppressed. This would effectively reduce the optimal average charge of the ions in the metal, and decrease the strength of interactions.
Finally, $\ce{Cr}$ doesn't show the same electronic behaviour as $\ce{Mn}$ and $\ce{Tc},$ even though it has a $d^5$ configuration, and yet it is still anomalous. What gives? Well, according to Greenwood and Earnshaw (Chemistry of the Elements, 1997), the low boiling point of $\ce{Cr}$ is due to a combination of increased effective nuclear charge and the anomalously small size of $3d$ orbitals. When going from $\ce{V}$ to $\ce{Cr},$ the increase in nuclear charge is enough to pull the already small $3d$ orbitals quite close to the nucleus, disfavouring electron delocalization to the extent that a sudden drop appears. Mo has the same electron configuration as $\ce{Cr},$ yet it does not show nearly as large a dip because its $4d$ orbitals are already significantly more diffuse, and aren't so easily suppressed from delocalizing."
Which compound reacts faster in the Cannizzaro Reaction?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33049/which-compound-reacts-faster-in-the-cannizzaro-reaction,12k,"The mechanism of the Cannizzaro reaction is illustrated below.

The first step involves attack by the nucleophilic hydroxide ion on the positively polarized carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral intermediate.  Once the tetrahedral intermediate is formed, substituents on the aromatic ring can have little resonance interaction with the former carbonyl carbon because it is now $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized. So we need to look at the step leading to the tetrahedral intermediate - the first step.
However, if we examine some of the resonance structures for the starting carbonyl compounds (where the substituents on the aromatic ring can interact with the carbonyl through resonance) we see that the nitro compound places positive charge adjacent to the already positive polarized carbonyl carbon - a destabilizing situation (remember, destabilizing something means making it higher energy, more reactive).  On the other hand, the methoxy compound places negative charge adjacent to the already positive polarized carbonyl carbon - a stabilizing situation.
The destabilized carbonyl in the nitro compound will be more reactive towards nucleophilic attack."
"Are all NO3- salts soluble in water? If so, why?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32426/are-all-no3-salts-soluble-in-water-if-so-why,30k,"No, the correct way of putting it is
$$\mathrm{Almost~all~of~the~\mathbf{inorganic}~nitrate~salts~are~soluble~in~water. }$$
The families of organic nitrate salts are typically nitrates of azoles and imidazoles. Some bright examples are (R) & (S)-miconazole nitrates, isoconazole nitrate and econazol nitrate. Econazol nitrate (Other names: Spectazole, EN) is the most common organic nitrate salt, and is believed to be very slightly soluble in water, less than $0.1 \mathrm{\frac{g}{100~g}}$ (1, 2, 3)
In inorganic nitrate salts, with a bit of patience, I've noticed that barium nitrate, mercury(I) nitrate, and cobalt(III) nitrate are the least soluble of nitrate salts with a monoatomic cation. They are in the brink of insolubility, but I still wouldn't call them insoluble, since

Their solubility isn't that low at STP; somewhere around $\frac{5~\mathrm{g}}{100~\mathrm{g}}$. ($\ce{Hg2(NO3)2.2H2O}$ decomposes in water, so as RSC says)
Their solubility increases greatly with temperature.


The reason, you say?
Well, let's think of why one compound is soluble in water while the other isn't. When an ionic compound is formed, energy is released. This is called Lattice enthalpy in constant pressure. The process of formation of lattice from separate ions is usually highly exothermic. Therefore, when an ionic compound dissolves in water, and when this lattice ""breaks up"", the reaction would be highly endothermic. 
So, to dissolve in water, the ions have to 'overcome' the lattice energy. How? Of course, the net resulting attractions between water molecules and the ions have to be stronger. This attraction is kind of a formation of a very very weak bond (and its weakness is the reason it's not categorized as such) and thus, is exothermic. This energy release when the dissolution occurs is called enthalpy of hydration, provided that the ions be in the gaseous state.
So, nitrate is a really big anion, with a single charge. The lesser concentration of negative charge results in relatively lesser lattice enthalpies. Also, the possibility of the creation of hydrogen bonds with water enhances solubility by increasing enthalpy of hydration.
That's why almost all of nitrates are soluble."
Why does fructose reduce Tollen's reagent and Fehling's solution?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/40127/why-does-fructose-reduce-tollens-reagent-and-fehlings-solution,81k,"The presence of the hydrogen atom in the aldehyde group gives reducing properties to the aldehyde molecule. Aldehydes are easily oxidized by mild oxidizing agents such as Tollens’ reagent ($\ce{Ag+}$ in aqueous ammonia), Fehling’s reagent ($\ce{Cu^2+}$ complexed with tartrate), or Benedict’s reagent ($\ce{Cu^2+}$ complexed with citrate). Ketones do not have such reducing properties and are not oxidized under similar conditions. Therefore, Tollens’ reagent, Fehling’s reagent, or Benedict’s reagent can be used to distinguish aldehydes from ketones.
However, fructose reduces such reagents even though it contains no aldehyde group. Reduction occurs because the reagents are basic solutions and fructose is readily isomerized to a mixture of aldoses (glucose and mannose) under basic conditions.

Under basic conditions, the proton alpha to the carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) is reversibly removed. If the resulting enolate ion reprotonates on the oxygen, an enediol intermediate results. Thus, the base-catalyzed enediol rearrangemet can move the carbonyl group up and down the chain.
Furthermore, in the enolate ion, the affected carbon atom is no longer asymmetric. Reprotonation can occur on either face of the enolate, giving either configuration. Thus, the base-catalyzed epimerization results in a mixture of stereoisomers.
Therefore, under strongly basic conditions, the combination of enediol rearrangements and epimerization leads to a complex mixture of sugars (see also: Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation)."

"Why is water ""the universal"" solvent?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/21898/why-is-water-the-universal-solvent,17k,"TL;DR: Water is incredibly easy to get and work with.

In full
Water is a good solvent for polar compounds[citation needed], and the reasons for this are laid out pretty well by John Snow, but that's not really what makes it the universal solvent.
Instead, a series of other, incidental properties makes it a popular choice:
Availability
There's a lot of water[citation needed]. It literally falls from the sky. This means that for most applications, it's the absolutely cheapest solvent available.
Reactivity
Water is a reasonably stable molecule. Few things you can dissolve in water are expected to react significantly with it. It won't readily burn or combust, even in vapour form, and its high heat capacity and prevalence (see above) means that it can effectively douse most runaway reactions that might occur, such as fires (there are times when adding water to a fire is a bad idea, especially perhaps in a lab, but even those times the problem can be solved by adding a lot of water).
Toxicity
Unlike some other common solvents, water is not toxic[citation needed], and is not a bio- or eco-hazard. This means that unused solvent can be disposed of without special precautions, and if the solute can be disposed of trivially, the solvent can as well.
Purity and stability
Water is everywhere[citation needed], giving it another unique property: Unlike many other solvents, water won't absorb atmospheric water vapour, decreasing its purity as a matter of course. (It'll still exchange water with the atmospheric vapour, of course, but it doesn't significantly change its make-up.)
Distilled 100 % water will remain more or less pure unless something is actively added to it, which, while not unique, is useful and somewhat uncommon. Water molecules will also not spontaneously decompose under most sane conditions.
Operating temperatures
Water is liquid at a wide range of temperatures, stretching from 0°C to 100°C. Under laboratory conditions of ~1 atm and 20-25°C, water is a well-behaved and practical liquid.
Furthermore, while the liquid phase is available at a wide range of temperatures, the solid and gaseous states are not out of reach when using even extremely basic equipment. Cooling water to well below freezing, say -18°C, or to boiling, are both trivial activities, using equipment that is not only available in every lab, but even most homes.
In short...
Water isn't always the best tool for the job, but it's almost always a good or great one, at least when working with polar compounds. A common alternative to water is ethyl alcohol, which has similar polar properties and operating temperatures, but ethanol does have weaknesses in the other categories mentioned here, i.e. its reactivity, its absorption of water vapour, and its price."
Why isn't the American nickel magnetic?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/130963/why-isnt-the-american-nickel-magnetic,16k,"There are many types of magnetic properties, including ferromagnetism, paramagnetism, diamagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, superparamagnetism, metamagnetism, spin glasses, and helimagnetism.

Why does water evaporate spontaneously at room temperature despite ΔG > 0?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/28399/why-does-water-evaporate-spontaneously-at-room-temperature-despite-%ce%94g-0,21k,"Standard Gibbs free energy of formation of liquid water at 298 K is −237.17 kJ/mol and that of water vapour is −228.57 kJ/mol. Therefore, $$\ce{H2O(l)->H2O(g)}~~\Delta G=8.43~\mathrm{kJ/mol}$$
Since $\Delta G>0$, it should not be a spontaneous process but from common observation, water does turn into vapour from liquid over time without any apparent interference.

Your math is correct but you left out a very important symbol from your equations.  There is a big difference between $\Delta G$ and $\Delta G^\circ$.  Only $\Delta G^\circ$ means the Gibbs energy change under standard conditions, and as you noted in the question, the free energy values you quoted are the standard gibbs free energy of water and water vapor.
Whether or not something is spontaneous under standard conditions is determined by $\Delta G^\circ$.  Whether something is spontaneous under other conditions is determined by $\Delta G$.  To find $\Delta G$ for real conditions, we need to know how they differ from standard conditions.
Usually ""standard"" conditions for gases correspond to one bar of partial pressure for that gas.  But the partial pressure of water in our atmosphere is usually much lower than this.  Assuming water vapor is an ideal gas, then the free energy change as a function of partial pressure is given by $G = G^\circ + RT \ln{\frac{p}{p^\circ}}$.  If the atmosphere were perfectly 100% dry, then the water vapor partial pressure would be 0, so $\ln{\frac{p}{p^\circ}}$ would be negative infinity.  That would translate to an infinitely negative -- i.e. highly spontaneous -- $\Delta G$ for the water evaporation reaction.
Small but not-quite zero dryness in the atmosphere would still lead to the $\Delta G$ of water vapor that is more negative than liquid water.  So water evaporation is still spontaneous.
Extra credit: given the standard formation energies you found, and assuming water is an ideal gas, you could calculate the partial pressure of water vapor at which $\Delta G = 0$ for water evaporation.  And the answer had better be the vapor pressure of water, or else there is a thermodynamic inconsistency in your data set!"
Why is silver chloride less soluble than silver nitrate?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/410/why-is-silver-chloride-less-soluble-than-silver-nitrate,22k,"In the comment to my previous answer, you asked for a theoretical reason for the solubilities, not considering energy data. Since I know from energy considerations that the issue is not the solvation of the anions, I can present a reason based on the strength of the ionic bond in the two compounds. This reference (as well as others) states the bonding in $\ce{AgCl}$ has an unusually high covalent character which makes it a tighter bond. The $\ce{Ag+}$ ion and the $\ce{Cl-}$ ion are close to the same size (with the silver ion being smaller), so they can approach each other quite closely. In silver nitrate, the $\ce{NO3-}$ ion is larger and does not allow as close an approach as the chloride ion, so the bond is weaker, easier to break up, and the salt is more soluble."
What do the quantum numbers actually signify?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/31639/what-do-the-quantum-numbers-actually-signify,38k,"Quantum numbers give information about the location of an electron or set of electrons.  A full set of quantum numbers describes a unique electron for a particular atom.  
Think about it as the mailing address to your house.  It allows one to pinpoint your exact location out of a set of $n$ locations you could possibly be in.  We can narrow the scope of this analogy even further.  Consider your daily routine.  You may begin your day at your home address but if you have an office job, you can be found at a different address during the work week.  Therefore we could say that you can be found in either of these locations depending on the time of day.  The same goes for electrons.  Electrons reside in atomic orbitals (which are very well defined 'locations').  When an atom is in the ground state, these electrons will reside in the lowest energy orbitals possible (e.g. 1$s^2$ 2$s^2$ and 2$p^2$ for carbon).  We can write out the physical 'address' of these electrons in a ground-state configuration using quantum numbers as well as the location(s) of these electrons when in some non-ground (i.e. excited) state.
You could describe your home location any number of ways (GPS coordinates, qualitatively describing your surroundings, etc.) but we've adapted to a particular formalism in how we describe it (at least in the case of mailing addresses).  The quantum numbers have been laid out in the same way.  We could communicate with each other that an electron is ""located in the lowest energy, spherical atomic orbital"" but it is much easier to say a spin-up electron in the  1$s$ orbital instead.  The four quantum numbers allows us to communicate this information numerically without any need for a wordy description.
Of course carbon is not always going to be in the ground state.  Given a  wavelength of light for example, one can excite carbon in any number of ways.  Where will the electron(s) go?  Regardless of what wavelength of light we use, we know that we can describe the final location(s) using the four quantum numbers.  You can do this by writing out all the possible permutations of the four quantum numbers.  Of course, with a little more effort, you could predict the exact location where the electron goes but in my example above, you know for a fact you could describe it using the quantum number formalism.
The quantum numbers also come with a set of restrictions which inherently gives you useful information about where electrons will NOT be. For instance, you could never have the following possible quantum numbers for an atom:
$n$=1; $l$=0; $m_l$=0; $m_s$=1/2
$n$=1; $l$=0; $m_l$=0; $m_s$=-1/2
$n$=1; $l$=0; $m_l$=0; $m_s$=1/2
This set of quantum numbers indicates that three electrons reside in the 1$s$ orbital which is impossible!
As Jan stated in his post, these quantum numbers are derived from the solutions to the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom (or a 1-e$^-$ system).  There are any number of solutions to this equation that relate to the possible energy levels of they hydrogen atom.  Remember, energy is QUANTIZED (as postulated by Max Planck).  That means that an energy level may exist (arbitrarily) at 0 and 1 but NEVER in between.  There is a discrete 'jump' in energy levels and not some gradient between them.  From these solutions a formalism was constructed to communicate the solutions in a very easy, numerical way just as mailing addresses are purposefully formatted in such a way that is easy that anyone can understand with minimal effort.
In summary, the quantum numbers not only tell you where electrons will be (ground state) and can be (excited state), but also will tell you where electrons cannot be in an atom (due to the restrictions for each quantum number).

Principle quantum number ($n$) - indicates the orbital size.  Electrons in atoms reside in atomic orbitals.  These are referred to as $s,p,d,f...$ type orbitals.  A $1s$ orbital is smaller than a $2s$ orbital.  A $2p$ orbital is smaller than a $3p$ orbital.  This is because orbitals with a larger $n$ value are getting larger due to the fact that they are further away from the nucleus.  The principle quantum number is an integer value where $n$ = 1,2,3... .
Angular quantum number ($l$) - indicates the shape of the orbital. Each type of orbital ($s,p,d,f..$) has a characteristic shape associated with it.  $s$-type orbitals are spherical while $p$-type orbitals have 'dumbbell' orientations.  The orbitals described by $l$=0,1,2,3... are $s,p,d,f...$ orbitals, respectively.  The angular quantum number ranges from 0 to $n$-1.  Therefore, if $n$ = 3, then the possible values of $l$ are 0, 1, 2.
Magnetic quantum number ($m_l$) - indicates the orientation of a particular orbital in space.  Consider the $p$ orbitals.  This is a set of orbitals consisting of three $p$-orbitals that have a unique orientation in space.  In Cartesian space, each orbital would like along an axis (x, y, or z) and would be centered around the origin at 0,0.  While each orbital is indeed a $p$-orbital, we can describe each orbital uniquely by assigning this third quantum number to indicate its position in space.  Therefore, for a set of $p$-orbitals, there would be three $m_l$, each uniquely describing one of these orbitals.  The magnetic quantum number can have values of $-l$ to $l$.  Therefore, in our example above (where $l$ = 0,1,2) then $m_l$ would be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.
Spin quantum number ($m_s$) - indicates the 'spin' of the electron residing in some atomic orbital.  Thus far we have introduced three quantum numbers that localize a position to an orbital of a particular size, shape and orientation.  We now introduce the fourth quantum number that describes the type of electron that can be in that orbital.  Recall that two electrons can reside inside one atomic orbital.  We can define each one uniquely by indicating the electron's spin.  According to the Pauli-exclusion principle, no two electrons can have the exact same four quantum numbers.  This means that two electrons in one atomic orbital cannot have the same 'spin'. We generally denote 'spin-up' as $m_s$ =1/2 and spin-down as $m_s$=-1/2."

Rationalising the order of reactivity of carbonyl compounds towards nucleophiles,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14618/rationalising-the-order-of-reactivity-of-carbonyl-compounds-towards-nucleophiles,60k,"Here is my ""old school"" explanation.  
Below is a drawing of the reaction coordinate for nucleophilic attack at a carbonyl carbon. The energy well for the starting carbonyl compound is shown on the left.  As the positively-polarized carbonyl reacts with (forms a bond with) the nucleophile we pass over a transition state and fall into a second potential well representing the tetrahedral intermediate.  $\ce{E_{act}}$ is the activation energy required to pass over the transition state.  To whatever extent a substituent might stabilize the starting carbonyl compound, the energy of the carbonyl compound will be lowered, and consequently $\ce{E_{act}}$ will increase.  The central carbon (it was the carbonyl carbon) in the tetrahedral intermediate is fully saturated (just $\ce{sp^3}$ bonds) and without charge, so the substituent X cannot interact through resonance to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate.  In other words, while substituent X can stabilize or destabilize the starting carbonyl compound, it should have little effect on the relative energetic position of the tetrahedral intermediate.

Below are the resonance structures we can draw for our carbonyl compound.

If structure III contributes significantly to the overall description of the compound, then we would expect that carbonyl compound to be more stable, lower in energy, than a carbonyl compound where structure III contributes little.  
Let's start by comparing the ester to the amide.  In both cases structure III involves a 2p-2p pi bond, but the resultant positive charge is placed on oxygen when we start with the ester and on nitrogen when we start with the amide.  Clearly, for electronegativity reasons, the amide case is better with the positive charge on the less electronegative amide nitrogen.  Our prediction: the amide is more stabilized than the ester and therefor should be the slower reacting of the two.
$$\ce{ester > amide}$$
In the case of the carboxylate anion, resonance structure III is equivalent to resonance structure I (note: there is no positive charge in structure III for the carboxylate case).  Since they are equivalent, they carry high weight stabilizing and in describing the carboxylate anion.  The carboxylate anion is so stabilized by resonance structures I and III that it is basically unreactive to nucleophiles
$$\ce{ester > amide >> carboxylate}$$
There's really no difference between the ester and carboxylic acid in terms of resonance structure III contribution so we would expect them to have similar reactivity towards a nucleophile.
$$\ce{ester \sim acid > amide >> carboxylate}$$
Let's compare the ester to the anhydride.  Resonance structure III is equally effective for both compounds, BUT, there are two carbonyls in the anhydride for the oxygen to interact with.  Therefor, the oxygen will only be half as effective at stabilizing any one anhydride carbonyl as it was for the ester carbonyl.
$$\ce{anhydride > ester \sim acid > amide >> carboxylate}$$
In the case of the acid chloride, resonance structure III involves a 2p-3p pi bond, not very effective overlap due to the size difference (also chlorine is electronegative so placing a positive charge on it is not desirable, but the poor pi overlap is what limits the contribution from structure III in the acid chloride case).
$$\ce{acid~ chloride > anhydride > ester \sim acid > amide >> carboxylate}$$
For the ketone, our resonance structure III has a slightly different look, it involves hyperconjugation as shown in the following figure.

Since there are 3 hydrogens, there are three such hyperconjugated structures,  They are not super significant resonance structures, but there are 3 of them, they do place the positive charge on a proton, so they do count for some stabilization.  To be honest, I would have guessed that it creates more stabilization than resonance structure III in the acid chloride case, but I wouldn't have known where it fits between the acid chloride and the ester.  Wherever I put it, I'd put the aldehyde to its left.  There is no resonance structure III for the aldehyde.
I wind up with 
$$\ce{acid~ chloride > anhydride > ester \sim acid > amide >> carboxylate}$$
and $\ce{aldehyde > ketone}$ fitting in somewhere between the acid chloride and the ester"
Why do cyclic hydrocarbons have higher boiling points than their acyclic isomers?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32399/why-do-cyclic-hydrocarbons-have-higher-boiling-points-than-their-acyclic-isomers,37k,"Your intuition is indeed correct! Several sources provide the same answer (1, 2, 3). Perhaps the simplest and most direct evidence comes from comparing the densities of the liquid unbranched alkanes and cycloalkanes:

(Source)
The cycloalkanes have slightly lower molecular mass than their parent unbranched alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms, yet the cycloalkanes are consistently more dense in the liquid phase by a factor of ~20%. The only way this can happen is if each individual cycloalkane molecule effectively occupies less volume in the liquid phase than the related alkane. This means cycloalkane molecules are closer on average in the liquid, and as van der Waals forces are attractive (at intermolecular separations) and their strength varies inversely with distance, the intermolecular attractions are stronger in cycloalkanes, and so the boiling point of the cycloalkanes should be higher.
This can be explained by considering that the unbranched linear chains in alkanes have many possible conformations, and thus are in more geometrically irregular contact in the liquid, leaving more space on average between the molecules. Cycloalkanes do not have as many conformations available, and so their molecules will approach each other more orderly and effectively, leaving less intermolecular space. 
Presumably this effect can be extended to all substances (including the ethers mentioned in the question you linked), but it need not always be the dominant factor in determining boiling points."

However, a full description of the middle three metals is beyond the scope of this question. I just thought it was worth pointing out that the trend is not really straightforward.

The $\ce{M+}/\ce{M}$ standard reduction potential is related to $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G^\circ$ for the reaction
$$\ce{M(s) -> M+(aq) + e-}$$
by the equation
$$E^\circ = \frac{\Delta_\mathrm{r}G^\circ + K}{F}$$
where $K$ is the absolute standard Gibbs free energy for the reaction
$$\ce{H+ + e- -> 1/2 H2}$$
and is a constant (which means we do not need to care about its actual value). Assuming that $\Delta_\mathrm{r} S^\circ$ is approximately independent of the identity of the metal $\ce{M}$, then the variations in $\Delta_\mathrm{r}H^\circ$ will determine the variations in $\Delta_\mathrm{r}G^\circ$ and hence $E^\circ$. We can construct an energy cycle to assess how $\Delta_\mathrm{r}H^\circ$ will vary with the identity of $\ce{M}$. The standard state symbol will be dropped from now on.
$$\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
\ce{M (s)} @>{\large \Delta_\mathrm{r}H}>> \ce{M+(aq) + e-} \\
@V{\large\Delta_\mathrm{atom}H(\ce{M})}VV @AA{\large\Delta_\mathrm{hyd}H(\ce{M+})}A \\
\ce{M (g)} @>>{\large IE_1(\ce{M})}> \ce{M+ (g) + e-}
\end{CD}$$
We can see, as described in Prajjawal's answer, that there are three factors that contribute to $\Delta_\mathrm{r}H$:
$$\Delta_\mathrm{r}H = \Delta_\mathrm{atom}H + IE_1 + \Delta_\mathrm{hyd}H$$
(the atomisation enthalpy being the same as the sublimation enthalpy). You are right in saying that there is a decrease in $IE_1$ going from $\ce{Li}$ to $\ce{Cs}$. If taken alone, this would mean that $E(\ce{M+}/\ce{M})$ would decrease going from $\ce{Li}$ to $\ce{Cs}$, which would mean that $\ce{Cs}$ is a better reducing agent than $\ce{Li}$.
However, looking at the very first table, this is clearly not true. So, some numbers will be needed. All values are in $\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}$.
$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hline
\ce{M} & \Delta_\mathrm{atom}H & IE_1 & \Delta_\mathrm{hyd}H & \text{Sum} \\
\hline
\ce{Li} & 161 & 520 & \mathbf{-520} & 161 \\
\ce{Cs} & 79 & 376 & \mathbf{-264} & 211 \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

This is, in fact, an extremely crude analysis. However, it hopefully does serve to show in a more quantitative way why $E(\ce{Cs+}/\ce{Cs}) > E(\ce{Li+}/\ce{Li})$: it's because of the extremely exothermic hydration enthalpy of the small $\ce{Li+}$ ion.
Just as a comparison, the ionic radii of $\ce{Li+}$ and $\ce{Cs+}$ ($\mathrm{CN} = 6$) are $76$ and $167~\mathrm{pm}$ respectively (Greenwood & Earnshaw, p 75)."
Which molecule is more acidic: CHF3 or CHBr3?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/67106/which-molecule-is-more-acidic-chf3-or-chbr3,11k,"The following table contains some relevant data, the $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$'s of the various haloforms along with the Pauling electronegativity of the corresponding halogen.
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline
\text{Haloform} & \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} & \text{Electronegativity}\\ \hline
\ce{CHF3} & 25\mathrm{-}28 & 3.98\\ \hline
\ce{CHCl3} & 15.7 & 3.16\\ \hline
\ce{CHBr3} & 13.7 & 2.96\\ \hline
\ce{CHI3} & \sim 25 & 2.66\\ \hline
\end{array}
Looking at the $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$'s, the first thing we notice is that the two haloforms at the beginning and end of the series are weaker acids than the two haloforms in the middle of the series. This behavior is often seen when there are at least two factors affecting acidity and they are in opposition to each other.
Let's consider inductive, steric and resonance effects and examine their expected effect upon haloform acidity.

Inductive effects should correlate with electronegativity.  Based only on inductive effects we would expect fluoroform to ionize and produce the most inductively stabilized cabanion ($\ce{CF3^{-}}$), while iodoform would ionize to produce the least inductively stabilized carbanion ($\ce{CI3^{-}}$).
Steric effects are often discussed in terms of bulky groups coming too close to one another, but what we are really saying is that the electron clouds around the groups are coming too close to one another causing electron-electron repulsion. Iodoform is a very bulky molecule.  The iodine substituents are very large and there are many lone pair-lone pair repulsions.  Upon ionizing iodoform can relax from a crowded $\mathrm{sp^3}$-like geometry to a more open and spread out $\mathrm{sp^2}$-like geometry.  As the halogen gets smaller there is less of a steric \ electron repulsion driving force for haloform ionization.
Resonance effects are not a significant stabilizing factor in the haloform series. Significant low energy resonance structures cannot be drawn. Thanks to TanYongBoon for noting this.

Conclusion: Inductive effects and steric effects (steric meaning electron-electron repulsion) control acidity in the haloform series. The two effects are in opposition to one another.  The inductive effect strongly stabilizes the fluoroform anion and plays a lesser role as we move down the series.  Steric \ electron repulsion effects strongly stabilize the iodoform anion and plays a lesser role as we move up the series.  Said differently, only one effect stabilizes the fluoroform (inductive) and iododform (steric) anions, but both inductive and steric effects play a role in stabilizing the chloroform and bromoform anions making chloroform and bromoform the most acidic molecules in the series."
Why is 2-methylpropene less in energy than its alkene counterparts?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/27346/why-is-2-methylpropene-less-in-energy-than-its-alkene-counterparts,21k,"There are two things we need to understand before we can answer the question.
1) More highly substituted double bonds are generally more stable than less substituted double bonds. 
This is because the $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized carbon in the alkyl group is electron donating towards the $\ce{sp^2}$  hybridized carbon in the double bond. Electron density likes to flow from low to high s-character orbitals since the more s-character in an orbital, the lower the energy of the electrons in that orbital.  As the electrons flow from the $\ce{sp^3}$ carbon to the $\ce{sp^2}$ carbon the energy of the electrons (and therefore the energy of the molecule) is lowered.
A ""shorthand"" way to illustrate this electron flow is by drawing hyperconjugated resonance structures like the following. 

Consequently 2-butene (where we can draw 6 hyperconjugated resonance structures) is more stable than 1-butene (where we can only draw 2 hyperconjugated resonance structures).
2) Carbanion stability decreases in the order primary > secondary > tertiary
As we've just shown above, alkyl groups are electron releasing.  If we have a negative charge on a carbon (a carbanion), the last thing we want is to have more alkyl groups attached to that carbon releasing more electron density onto an already negative carbon atom.
Now we can return to your question and try to understand why 2-methylpropene is more stable than trans-2-butene.   Carbon-hydrogen hyperconjugation is at the center of the answer.  Let's compare some of the hyperconjugated resonance structures that can be drawn for these two molecules. 

Remembering that a) more highly substituted double bonds are more stable and b) that primary carbanions are more stable than secondary carbanions, we can compare hyperconjugated resonance structures A and B. Resonance structure A contains a disubstituted double (more stable) and a primary carbanion (more stable), while resonance structure B contains a monosubstituted double bond (less stable) and a secondary carbanion (less stable). Therefore, resonance structure A should be more stable than resonance structure B.  Since resonance structure A is more stable than resonance structure B, 2-methylpropene will be more stable than trans-2-butene.
Finally, we note that cis-2-butene is less stable that trans-2-butene for steric reasons.  This allows us to place these $\ce{C_4}$ isomers in the following order of stability:
2-methylpropene is more stable than trans-2-butene which is more stable than cis-2-butene, which is more stable than 1-butene. If we examine the heats of combustion for these isomers, we see that our order of stability is confirmed.

Why is ethyne and not ethene used for welding?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/26769/why-is-ethyne-and-not-ethene-used-for-welding,14k,"An acetylene molecule is composed of two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms. The two carbon atoms are held together by what is known as a triple carbon bond. This bond is useful in that it stores substantial energy that can be released as heat during combustion.The triple bond which makes the oxy-acetylene flame the hottest of all gas flames is also responsible for two rather exceptional properties of acetylene gas. 
The first is: If free gaseous acetylene is subjected to severe shock, or a source of ignition, some of the triple bonds may break, releasing enough energy to cause all the other molecules in the enclosed volume to decompose into carbon and hydrogen with explosive force. The force of such an explosion is not so great as that released by the explosion of most mixtures of acetylene and oxygen, or acetylene and air, but it is substantial, and can be withstood only by extra-heavy-wall steel tubing. 
The other property of acetylene is that the flammability range of mixtures of air and acetylene is broader than that of any other fuel gas/air mixture. Acetylene/air mixtures can be ignited when they contain anywhere from 2.5 percent acetylene to 80 percent acetylene. Mixtures of methane (the principal component of natural gas) and air are flammable when they contain as little as 5 percent methane and not more than 15 percent methane. 
To be suitable for welding operations, a fuel gas, when burned with oxygen, must have the following:

High flame temperature.
High rate of flame propagation.
Adequate heat content.
Minimum chemical reaction of the flame with base and filler metals.

Among the commercially available Oxy Fuel welding fuel gases, acetylene (combination of hydrogen and carbon) most closely meets all these requirements. Other gases, fuel such as MAPP gas, propylene, propane, natural gas, and proprietary gases based on these, have sufficiently high flame temperatures but exhibit low flame propagation rates."
Confusion about direction of dipole arrow in alpha-helices and other molecules,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33379/confusion-about-direction-of-dipole-arrow-in-alpha-helices-and-other-molecules,14k,"I (accidentally) stumbled upon the following statement in Atkins' ""Elements of Physical Chemistry"" (p378):

We represent dipole moments by an arrow with a length proportional to $\pmb{\mu}$ and pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge (1). (Be careful with this convention: for historical reasons the opposite convention is still widely used.)

Unfortunately he does not go into more detail. And I know this does not really answer your question.
The definition from the IUPAC is the same as the one used by Atkins:

electric dipole moment, $\mathbf{p}$
  Vector quantity, the vector product of which with the electric field strength, $\mathbf{E}$, of a homogeneous field is equal to the torque.  $\mathbf{T} = \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{E}$. The direction of the dipole moment is from the negative to the positive charge.

The source quoted there is from 1993, so you can probably understand my surprise, when I did a little more searching and found in C. Párkányi's ""Theoretical Organic Chemistry"" (1997, p239):

[...] in organic chemistry the positive direction of the dipole moment is normally defined as the direction from the center of the positive charge towards the center of the negative charge. This convention prevails in physical organic chemistry and in inorganic chemistry. However, while the dipole still points from the positive charge to the negative charge, in physical chemistry and in chemical physics the positive direction of the dipole moment is defined in the opposite way, i.e., from the negative charge to the positive charge.

There are also a few sources given, but I currently have not enough time to look them up. I find this statement (definition) highly confusing and it also does not give another reason why this is the direction it uses. Please forgive me for not going into more detail here, I really don't want to add any more to the confusion.
Conclusion
Don't add to the confusion. Use
$$\huge\ominus \overset{\mathbf{p}}{\longrightarrow}\oplus$$
as your definition from now on. Popular use does not make it right. Help using it consistently in the correct way and flush out the historic remnants that are still being taught. However, keep Atkins' warning in mind when you read books, paper, etc.. In the literature you will find both versions.

If anyone wants to argue with you about this, give the following derivation. The dipole moment operator $\mathbf{P}$ is a vector operator  that is the sum of the position vectors $\mathbf{r}$ of all $N$ charged particles weighted with their charge $q$.[goldbook]
$$\mathbf{P} = \sum_i^N q_i \mathbf{r}_i$$
For a molecule (neutral by definition)
we find 
$$\begin{align}
  0& =\sum_i^N q_i &\Leftrightarrow&&
  0&=\sum_{i_+}^{N_+}q_{i_+} + \sum_{i_-}^{N_-}q_{i_-} &\Leftrightarrow&&
  \sum_{i_+}^{N_+}q_{i_+} &= - \sum_{i_-}^{N_-}q_{i_-} &.
\end{align}$$
This can be transformed into
$$\sum_{i_+}^{N_+}|q_{i_+}|\mathrm{e} = 
- \sum_{i_-}^{N_-}|q_{i_-}|(\mathrm{-e}).$$
Therefore we can write
$$\begin{align}
  \mathbf{P} &= \sum_{i_+}^{N_+} q_{i_+} \mathbf{r}_{i_+} 
             + \sum_{i_-}^{N_-} q_{i_-} \mathbf{r}_{i_-}
             &\Leftrightarrow&&
  \mathbf{P} &= \mathrm{e}\left(
                \sum_{i_+}^{N_+} |q_{i_+}| \mathbf{r}_{i_+} 
              - \sum_{i_-}^{N_-} |q_{i_-}| \mathbf{r}_{i_-} 
                \right)&.
\end{align}$$
In the parenthesis the first term is a linear combination of vectors for all positive charges with the resulting vector $\mathbf{r}_+$ and the second term is a linear combination for all negative charges with the resulting vector $\mathbf{r}_-$. The dipole operator is therefore equivalent to
$$\begin{align}
  \mathbf{P} &= \mathrm{e}\left(\mathbf{r}_{i_+} - \mathbf{r}_{i_-}\right),
\end{align}$$
which is a linear combination of vectors that points from negative to positive."
Is the t-butyl carbocation more stable than the benzyl carbocation?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/74943/is-the-t-butyl-carbocation-more-stable-than-the-benzyl-carbocation,17k,"I am using a very simplistic quantum chemical approach of the following isodesmic reaction:

I have used Gaussian 16 Rev. A.03 and the DF-B97D3/def2-TZVPP level of theory. The summaries of the calculations are included below.
On this level of theory the depicted reaction has an energy change of $\Delta G = \pu{- 37.1 kJ mol-1}.$ Therefore one could assume that the 2-methylpropan-2-ylium cation is more stable than the phenylmethylium cation. These values were estimated at $T = \pu{298.15 K}$ and $p = \pu{1 atm}.$
   
One certainly can do more calculations, but it is, however, a start.

How are solvents chosen in organic reactions?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/60342/how-are-solvents-chosen-in-organic-reactions,15k,"There is no list per se, but there is certainly a process to determine appropriate solvents for a given reaction. For the specific reaction you mention, here are some criteria you would consider to select a solvent: 

Because this is an oxidation reaction, choose a solvent that cannot be oxidized, known as an aprotic solvent.
The solvent needs to dissolve the reagents in the reaction: hypochlorite and 4-tert-butylcyclohexanol. Hypochlorite is a polar molecule, and 4-tert-butylcyclohexanol is a little polar thanks to the alcohol group. The alcohol group will be oxidized to a ketone by the reaction, so the solvent should be able to dissolve that reasonably well. Conclusion: choose a moderately polar solvent.

So a polar aprotic solvent is needed for this reaction. There are two more considerations: cost and safety
Obviously, the cheapest solvent with the lowest potential for harm should be selected.
A list of some common polar aprotic solvents for consideration might include:

tetrahydrofuran
N,N-dimethylformamide
acetonitrile
dimethyl sulfoxide
acetone

Tetrahydrofuran could be a reasonable choice, but it forms peroxides over time, which are quite explosive.
N,N-dimethylformamide has some health concerns: GHS07 and GHS08
Acetonitrile also falls into the GHS07 category: it causes cyanide to form in the body at high concentrations.
Dimethyl sulfoxide does not have health or safety concerns.
Acetone also falls into the GHS07 category: it can cause nausea and irritation at high exposure levels.
The health concerns of acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and acetone are largely not going to pose a hazard for a laboratory experiment. All three of these can likely be found in any organic teaching lab.
Cost comparison, from Sigma Aldrich:
Acetonitrile: 2 L = $172.50
Dimethyl sulfoxide: 2 L = $208.50
Acetone: 2 L = $94.80
Therefore, choose acetone for this reaction!"
Why are the C-C bonds in benzene closer in length to double bonds than single bonds?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/37688/why-are-the-c-c-bonds-in-benzene-closer-in-length-to-double-bonds-than-single-bo,17k,"one might expect that the bond lengths would be exactly intermediate between a single and a double bond

They actually are. The relevant reference structure, that can provide us lengths of single and double bond for $sp^2$ carbons with not conjugation involved is cyclooctatetraene. The article on the X-ray structure of cycloocta-1,3,5,7-tetrene gives lengths 1.47 and 1.33 angstrom, with their average (1.40) being the exactly value of C-C bond in benzene you provided."
"Addition of hydrogen bromide to 1,3-butadiene: thermodynamic and kinetic control",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/59964/addition-of-hydrogen-bromide-to-1-3-butadiene-thermodynamic-and-kinetic-control,42k,"Thermodynamic and kinetic control
This is a classic example of the concept of thermodynamic versus kinetic control of a reaction. Take a look at this energy profile diagram.1 The horizontal axis is a reaction coordinate, and the vertical axis represents Gibbs free energy.

In this scenario, the starting material $\ce{A}$ can react to form either $\ce{B}$ or $\ce{C}$. The formation of the product $\ce{C}$ has a lower activation energy, which means that it will form faster:
$$E_{\mathrm{a},\ce{AB}} > E_{\mathrm{a},\ce{AC}} \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad k_\ce{AB} < k_\ce{AC}$$
If we keep the temperature sufficiently low, the molecules of $\ce{C}$ - which are inevitably formed faster - will probably not have enough energy to overcome the reverse activation barrier. The forward reactions $\ce{A->B}$ and $\ce{A->C}$ are, under such conditions, effectively irreversible. Since the formation of $\ce{C}$ is faster, it will predominate, and the major product formed will be $\ce{C}$. This is known as kinetic control; $\ce{C}$ is the kinetic product.
Now, what happens if we heat it up? At higher temperatures, $\ce{C}$ is still going to be the product that is formed faster. However, it also means that all the reactions will be reversible. This means that molecules of $\ce{C}$ can revert back to $\ce{A}$ - and since the system is no longer limited by temperature, it will try its best to minimise its Gibbs free energy, which is the thermodynamic criterion for chemical equilibrium. This means that, as the most thermodynamically stable molecule, $\ce{B}$ will be predominantly formed.2 The reaction is said to be under thermodynamic control, and $\ce{B}$ is the thermodynamic product.
A simple definition is that the kinetic product is the product that is formed faster, and the thermodynamic product is the product that is more stable. This is precisely what is happening here. The kinetic product is 3-bromobut-1-ene, and the thermodynamic product is 1-bromobut-2-ene (specifically, the trans isomer).
A disclaimer
Note that not every reaction has an energy profile diagram like this, and not every reaction has different thermodynamic and kinetic products! If the transition state leading to the formation of $\ce{C}$ were to be higher in energy than that leading to $\ce{B}$, then $\ce{B}$ would simultaneously be both the thermodynamic and kinetic product. There are plenty of reactions in which the more stable product (thermodynamic) is also formed faster (kinetic), so do not assume that every reaction fits this mould!
The reaction mechanism
The first step is the protonation of one of the $\ce{C=C}$ double bonds. In butadiene (1), both double bonds are the same, so it does not matter which one you protonate. The protonation occurs regioselectively to give the more stable carbocation:

The more stable cation is not only secondary, but also allylic, and therefore enjoys stabilisation via resonance (or conjugation). This is depicted in the resonance forms 2a and 2b above.
This allylic carbocation, more properly denoted as the resonance hybrid 2, has two carbons which have significant positive charge, and the bromide ion (here denoted as $\ce{X-}$) can attack either carbon. Attacking the central carbon, adjacent to the site of protonation, leads to the kinetic product 4; attacking the terminal carbon, distant from the site of protonation, leads to the thermodynamic product 4.

There are some people who write that 3 results from attack of $\ce{X-}$ on resonance form 2a, and 4 from attack of $\ce{X-}$ on resonance form 2b. This is not correct! Resonance forms do not separately exist, and they are not distinct species that rapidly interconvert. As such, one cannot speak of one single resonance form undergoing a reaction. 
With that out of the way, let's examine why 4 is the thermodynamic product, and why 3 is the kinetic product.
The thermodynamic product: trans-1-bromobut-2-ene
It is perhaps simple enough to see why 4 is more stable than 3. It has an internal, disubstituted double bond, and we know that as a general rule of thumb, the thermodynamic stability of an alkene increases with increasing substitution. So, compared to the terminal, monosubstituted alkene 3, 4 is more stable.

Both the trans isomer 4 as well as the cis isomer 5 can be formed via attack of the nucleophile at the terminal carbon, and both are disubstituted alkenes. However, the trans isomer 4 is more stable than the cis isomer 5, because there is less steric repulsion between the two substituents on the double bond. As such, 4 is the thermodynamic product.
The kinetic product: 3-bromobut-1-ene
There are quite a few explanations on the Internet,3–6 and not all of them are correct.
The worst possible argument, which I have thankfully not seen yet, goes something along the lines of: resonance form 2a, being an allylic secondary carbocation, is more stable than resonance form 2b, which is an allylic primary carbocation. Therefore, resonance form 2a exists in greater proportion, and the nucleophile preferentially reacts with it, leading to the formation of 3.
However, this is patently incorrect, as discussed earlier! Individual resonance forms do not exist, and on top of that, such an argument suggests that we are looking for the more stable intermediate. In fact, we should be looking for the more stable transition state. The carbocation is an intermediate, and not a transition state.
The most common argument that I have seen is actually: since resonance form 2a is more stable than 2b, it contributes more towards the resonance hybrid 2. As such, the positive charge on the internal carbon is greater than the positive charge on the terminal carbon. The nucleophile, being negatively charged, is more strongly attracted to the more positively charged or more electrophilic carbon, and therefore attack there occurs faster (the transition state being stabilised by greater electrostatic interactions).
That's actually a very sensible explanation; with only the data that has been presented so far, we would not be able to disprove it, and it was indeed the accepted answer for quite a while.
The catch
In 1979, Nordlander et al. carried out a similar investigation on the addition of $\ce{DCl}$ to a different substrate, 1,3-pentadiene.7
This experiment was very ingenious, because it was designed to proceed via an almost symmetrical intermediate:

Resonance forms 7a and 7b are both allylic and secondary. There is a very minor difference in their weightages, arising from the different hyperconjugative ability of $\ce{C-D}$ vs $\ce{C-H}$ bonds,8 but in any case, it is not very large. Therefore, if we adopt the explanation in the previous section, one would expect there not to be any major kinetic pathway, and both 1,2- and 1,4-addition products (8 and 9) would theoretically be formed roughly equally.

Instead, it was found that the 1,2-addition product was favoured over the 1,4-addition product. For example, at $-78\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}$ in the absence of solvent, there was a roughly $75:25$ ratio of 1,2- to 1,4-addition products. Clearly, there is a factor that favours 1,2-addition that does not depend on the electrophilicity of the carbon being attacked!
The authors attributed this effect to an ion pair mechanism. This means that, after the double bond is protonated (deuterated in this case), the chloride counterion remains in close proximity to the carbocation generated. Immediately following dissociation of $\ce{DCl}$, the chloride ion is going to be much closer to $\ce{C-2}$ than it is to $\ce{C-4}$, and therefore attack at $\ce{C-2}$ is much faster.
In fact, normal electrophilic addition of $\ce{HX}$ to conjugated alkenes in polar solvents can also proceed via similar ion pair mechanisms.9,10 This is reflected by the greater proportion of syn addition products to such substrates.11

2 This does not mean that all of $\ce{A}$ will be converted to $\ce{B}$; the reaction is still an equilibrium, and equilibria always go forward and backward. In general, the minimum system Gibbs free energy ($G_\mathrm{syst}$) will occur at a certain proportion of $\ce{A}$, $\ce{B}$, and $\ce{C}$. However, since $\ce{B}$ has the lowest Gibbs free energy, it will be formed in a greater proportion than $\ce{C}$. See, for example, the colourful graph in this answer of mine.

8 Because of the larger reduced mass and lower zero-point energy, a $\ce{C-D}$ bond is stronger and therefore less willing to donate electron density into an adjacent empty $\mathrm{p}$ orbital. This is the origin of some secondary kinetic isotope effects; in our case, it means that 7a is marginally less stable than 7b.

What's the difference between PBE and B3LYP methods?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/11004/whats-the-difference-between-pbe-and-b3lyp-methods,40k,"PBE
The PBE functional${}^{[1]}$ belongs to the class of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals for the exchange-correlation energy $E_{\mathrm{xc}}$. Considering that the dependence $E_{\mathrm{xc}}[\rho]$ may be non-local, i.e. $E_{\mathrm{xc}}$ may depend on the density $\rho$ at a given point (locality), but also on $\rho$ nearby (non-locality) the assumption made by the local spin density approximation${}^{[2,3]}$ (LSDA) that $E_{\mathrm{xc}}[\rho]$ is strictly local leaves a lot room for improvement. But still LSDA is a good starting point since it is a rather simple efficient model that gives good results. The GGA functionals improve on LSDA in a way that's pretty much in the spirit of a Taylor series with LSDA as a starting point: When we are at a point, what happens further off depends not only on $\rho$ at that point, but also the gradient of $\rho$ at the point, etc. (much as in a Taylor series: if you want to go further you may need not only the gradient, but also the Laplacian, etc.). So, these functionals are typically constructed by adding gradient corrections to the LSDA functionals. But that is not a trivial thing to do and doing it ""naively"" leads to wrong results. Therefore, some GGA functionals are parametrized by fitting experimental data. But there are also some GGA functionals that achieve the inclusion of gradient correction without introducing experimentally fitted parameters which makes them valid for a wide range of systems. One example of such a parameter-free GGA functional is the one developped by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE). It is known for its general applicability and gives rather accurate results for a wide range of systems.
Side note: GGA functionals are frequently termed non-local
functionals in the literature. This is a somewhat misleading and actually sloppy terminology that should be avoided and since my above statements might be misread in that direction I want to make one thing perfectly clear: All GGA functionals are perfectly
local in the mathematical sense: the value of the functional at a point $\vec{r}$ depends only on information about the density $\rho(\vec{r})$, its gradient $\nabla\rho(\vec{r})$, and possibly other information at this very point and is absolutely independent of properties of $\rho(\vec{r}^{\, \prime})$  at points $\vec{r}^{\, \prime} \neq \vec{r}$. Calling these functionals 'non-local' is only motivated by the fact that these functionals go beyond the 'local' density approximation and of course the observation that knowledge of
the gradients is the first step towards accounting for the inhomogeneity of the real density.
B3LYP
The B3LYP approach${}^{[4,5,6]}$ belongs to the hybrid approximations for the exchange–hybrid correlation functional. The approximation is famous, because it gives very good results and, therefore, is extremely popular. The distinguishing feature of such hybrid approximations is that they mix in a certain amount of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange energy into the exchange and correlation obtained from other functionals. There is actually some justification for that: At the lower limit ($\lambda = 0$, where $\lambda$ is the coupling constant) of the so called coupling constant integration the exchange-correlation hole is equal to the exact exchange hole. This observation led Becke${}^{[7, 8]}$ to conclude that a fraction of exact exchange should be mixed with GGA exchange and correlation. The simplest such hybrid functional is
\begin{align}
E^{\mathrm{hyb}}_{\mathrm{xc}} = a E_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{exact}} + (1 − a) E^{\mathrm{GGA}}_{\mathrm{x}} + E^{\mathrm{GGA}}_{\mathrm{c}}
\end{align}
where the constant $a$ can be fitted empirically or estimated theoretically ${}^{[9, 10, 11]}$
as $a \approx \frac{1}{4}$ for molecules.
So far so good, but it smells like a witch's brew for the B3LYP exchange–correlation potential $E_{\mathrm{xc}}$: take the exchange–correlation energy from the LSDA
method, add a pinch (20%) of the difference between the Hartree–Fock exchange energy 
$E^{\mathrm{KS}}_{\mathrm{x}}$ (well, in fact, this is Kohn–Sham exchange energy, because the Slater determinant wave function, used to calculate it, is the Kohn–Sham determinant, not the Hartree–Fock one) and the LSDA $E^{\mathrm{LSDA}}_{\mathrm{x}}$. Then, mix well 72% of Becke exchange potential${}^{[12]}$ $E^{\mathrm{B88}}_{\mathrm{x}}$ which includes the 1988 correction, then strew in 81% of the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation potential${}^{[13]}$ $E^{\mathrm{LYP}}_{\mathrm{c}}$. You will like this homeopathic magic potion most if you conclude by putting in 19% of the Vosko–Wilk–Nusair potential$^{[14]}$ $E^{\mathrm{VWN}}_{\mathrm{c}}$:
\begin{align}
  E^{\mathrm{B3LYP}}_{\mathrm{xc}} = E^{\mathrm{LSDA}}_{\mathrm{xc}} + 0.2 (E^{\mathrm{KS}}_{\mathrm{x}} - E^{\mathrm{LSDA}}_{\mathrm{x}}) + 0.72 E^{\mathrm{B88}}_{\mathrm{x}} + 0.81 E^{\mathrm{LYP}}_{\mathrm{c}} + 0.19 E^{\mathrm{VWN}}_{\mathrm{c}}
\end{align}
So, you can see B3LYP contains lots of empirical parameters but that's fine as long as you only want the results and don't want to know why this is working :)

Thermodynamic vs Kinetic Sulphonation of Naphthalene,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/31711/thermodynamic-vs-kinetic-sulphonation-of-naphthalene,29k,"In contrast to many other electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, aromatic sulfonation is reversible, in other words it is an equilibrium. If you use a large excess of $\ce{SO3}$ you push the reaction to the sulfonation side; if you heat the sulfonated product in the absence of $\ce{SO3}$ it will de-sulfonate.  This makes sulfonation a nice method to 1) control where a second substituent will be introduced or 2) serve as a protecting group (block second substituent introduction) - and then when you are done, you simply de-sulfonate.
Now to your question
If we look at the intermediates leading to the 2 isomers we see that we can draw 2 resonance structures that preserve aromaticity in one ring for the transition state leading to naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, but only one resonance structure where the other aromatic ring remains intact for the 2-isomer (draw the resonance structures to convince yourself).  

(image source)
Therefore the transition state leading to the 1-isomer will be lower in energy and naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid will be formed fastest - it is the kinetically favored product.
However, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid is a few kcal/mol more stable than its 1-isomer. This is due to an adverse 1,8 steric interaction present in the 1-isomer.

(image source)
Because the sulfonation reaction is reversible, if we run it long enough at high temperature (favoring reversibility), eventually we will wind up with the thermodynamically preferred (more stable) product, the 2-isomer."

Yes, these are the six most important resonance structures for this compound. The reason ChemDraw complains is that it is trying to act smarter than you, and it most certainly is not. It interprets that negative formal charge on the carbon atom as implying a lone pair, since carbon can only have the negative charge if it also has a lone pair. When you add the lone pair and the charge, ChemDraw is suddenly stupid and thinks you have exceeded the octet on carbon (3 bonds + 1 explicit LP + 1 implied LP from the charge).

In the first structure, nitrogen is $\mathrm{sp^3}$ hybridised, but on all others it's clearly $\mathrm{sp^2}$ hybridised. So what does that mean? It's somewhere in between, but closer to $\mathrm{sp^3}$-hybridised?

If the lone pair on a nitrogen (or on any atom)) participates in resonance, then that nitrogen (or whatever) atom must be $\mathrm{sp^2}$-hybridized so that the the lone pair is in a $\mathrm{p}$-like orbital to ensure appropriate symmetry for $\pi$-overlap. Put another way, if an atom is $\mathrm{sp^2}$-hybridized in one resonance structure, then it is $\mathrm{sp^2}$-hybridized in all of them. Atoms that are $\mathrm{sp^2}$-hybridized and $\mathrm{sp^3}$-hybridized have differing geometries, which is not permitted in the resonance phenomenon. 
In truth, hybridization is an approximation we make to make quantum mechanics jive with molecular geometry. Geometry is real (empirically determinable) and hybridization is fictitious (not empirically determinable), but hybridization makes QM behave better conceptually and mathematically. Hybridization is also a useful predictor of chemical reactivity of various bonds and functional groups in organic chemistry. Experimentally, I would guess that the nitrogen atom is trigonal planar (or very close to it). Trigonal planar implies $\mathrm{sp^2}$-hybridized (not the other way around). 
In molecular orbital theory, we do away with the need for both resonance and hybridization. This molecule would have 7 $\pi$ orbitals formed from linear combinations of the p orbitals on the 6 participating carbon atoms and the nitrogen atom. The probability density function plots of these 7 orbitals will be more complex than you might be used to, but they will suggest the same electron density and charge density as a resonance hybrid assembled from your six resonance structures. See the Wikipedia article on conjugated systems, which is not very good but will give you the idea.

My reasoning is that the first structure contributes more.

The five charge-separated resonance structures are more important than you think, since they imply that the five-membered ring is aromatic like the surprisingly stable cyclopentadienyl carbanion. However, you might not yet be this far along in your studies of organic chemistry. At the introductory level of understanding of resonance in organic molecules, the first structure is most important for the reasons you list."
Products of Reimer–Tiemann reaction of 4-methylphenol,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/8379/products-of-reimer-tiemann-reaction-of-4-methylphenol,24k,"The Reimer-Tiemann reaction is known as the ortho-formylation of phenols under strongly alkaline conditions. 
It's not an addition of a carbene to a double bond, like the Simmons-Smith reaction, the pyrrole to pyridine ring enlargement or the Buchner expansion, which is catalyzed by transition metals.
As ron already pointed out, pH is one crucial requirement, having a phenol (and not just any other arene) is the other.

What we're actually facing here is the addition of a carbanion to a strongly electron-deficient carbene.
As again already described by ron, there is significant charge density at the 4-position of the phenolate, and the initial addition step might indeed happen here too.

The resulting intermediate can't rearomatize other than in a back reaction and that's what it will mainly do! Only a minor part will grab a proton and yield C.
That was close, but no cigar! Let's have a look at the addition at the 2-position.

Through the interplay of dienone, phenolate and phenol we get rid of one chloride and all further steps to the final benzaldehyde are likewise assisted by this tautomerism.
We still haven't answered the question why no 1,3-dialdehyde is formed. Let's have a look at the major product B under alkaline conditions and its resonance structures.

One of them looks like the enolate of a 1,3-dicarbonyl conpound, with additional charge distribution over the $\pi$ system. 
This species has a significantly lower localized electron density than the anion of the starting material. So, the party stops here.

Edit In a comment, it was asked whether the geminal dichloride will convert to the corresponding aldehyde under alkaline conditions.
Such a transformation could involve a nucleophilic substitution, leading to a geminal halohydrine which then eliminates HCl to furnish the aldehyde.
In the case of benzylic dihalides, this is possible even without the intramolecular assistance of a phenolate (cf. this example) using secondary amines as a base and in the case of diphenyldichloromethane, the transformation to benzophenone is achieved by heating in the presence of water.
In the case of C, the simple deprotonation of the dihalide might be a dead-end alternative pathway to substitution."

Is cyclobutadiene antiaromatic?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/18557/is-cyclobutadiene-antiaromatic,21k,"If we go back to your earlier question on Frost diagrams (I've reproduced the key figure below), we see why simple molecular orbital theory or the ""$4n+2$"" rule suggests that benzene is aromatic while cyclobutadiene is antiaromatic.  

Forming a planar, conjugated, 6-membered ring and placing 6 π-electrons in it creates a π-system that is energetically more stable than 3 conjugated C=C bonds (e.g. in hexa-1,3,5-triene). On the other hand, forming a planar, conjugated, 4-membered ring and placing 4 π-electrons in it creates a π-system that is energetically less stable than 2 conjugated C=C bonds (e.g. in butadiene).  For these reasons we say that the first system, benzene, is ""aromatic"", while the second system, cyclobutadiene, is ""antiaromatic"". Other measurements and physical phenomenon such as reactivity, bond lengths, ring currents, etc. support these conclusions.
Free cyclobutadiene has been observed as a transient intermediate.  Further theoretical analysis suggests that due to its lack of aromaticity it will distort from a square structure to a rectangular one with alternating single and double bonds (Jahn–Teller effect).

sources claim that this instability can be attributed to other factors such as ring and angle strain rather than antiaromaticity

It turns out that other systems involving the cyclobutadiene skeleton have been prepared and studied.  Derivatives of both the cyclobutadiene dication[1] ($4n+2$, $n=0$) and the cyclobutadiene dianion[2] ($4n+2$, $n=1$) have been prepared and studied.  Their stability is much less than that of benzene, but much more than that of cyclobutadiene. Placing two charges in these small rings results in extremely high coulombic repulsions in both the dianion and dication, and this may be a significant part of the explanation as to  why they are less stable than say, benzene.  The fact that they exist as planar structures, with appropriate ring currents and are more stable than cyclobutadiene suggests that the instability observed with cyclobutadiene is not due to ring strain and angle strain alone.  Rather the aromatic stabilization - antiaromatic destabilization suggested by simple MO theory seems to be involved.

Why do people often capitalize element names?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6381/why-do-people-often-capitalize-element-names,11k,"This is a Google ngram of the usage of the words: iodine, carbon, nitrogen, zinc and Iodine, Carbon, Nitrogen, Zinc (not at the beginning of the phrase).
There is no historical trend, at least not an usage of an archaic form (we can see that the maximum  usage of the capitalized element name is from 1900 to 1960 but normalized to the overall usage is steady).

We can make some hypothesis about why someone could choose to write capitalized element names:

If we must write element abbreviation capitalized (Zn, Cu, C, N) I  can think I have to write the element capitalized even if is not abbreviated.
Someone (me too) may think that if I write Zinc it is more unambiguous and means I'm talking about the concept of element ""all atoms with the same number of protons in the atomic nucleus"" and not about the metal zinc.  If you write report with some elemental techniques (XRF, AES) sometimes you feel the urge to specify to the reader (that maybe is not a chemist): ""when I write that I've found zinc I mean that in the sample could be present $\ce{Zn}$ but also $\ce{ZnO}$, $\ce{Zn+}$, $\ce{Zn^{2+}}$"".
The fact the atoms are identical and the definition of a proper noun is: ""a noun that in its primary application refers to a unique entity"" could induce to think that elements may fit the definition, and so gain the privilege to be capitalized.
In alchemy elements such water and fire were capitalized.


However up to my knowledge the form not capitalized is preferred even in the others languages, in Italian I'm sure."

Can we fill potato chips bags with a gas other than nitrogen?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/135436/can-we-fill-potato-chips-bags-with-a-gas-other-than-nitrogen,12k,"As Nilay Ghosh said, nitrogen is cheap.

Another fill gas to avoid is sulfur hexafluoride.

Why do we still need to know about the Rankine temperature scale?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/99321/why-do-we-still-need-to-know-about-the-rankine-temperature-scale,17k,"Rankine is commonly used in the aerospace industry in the United States.
Rankine is to Fahrenheit what Kelvin is for Celsius. So when people in the United States were creating programs and using equations that needed an absolute temperature, they used Rankine before Celsius became dominate for scientific calculations. The reason people still sometimes use it in the aerospace industry is that there are a lot of programs that were developed using Rankine, so in order to be compatible with those old programs, it's often simpler to just use Rankine in the new programs too.

Simple Explanation of orbitals,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/40646/simple-explanation-of-orbitals,10k,"Well, the first step is to stop thinking electrons as being very small balls that orbit around the nucleus in a circular path. This is known as the Bohr model. Despite this model being an excellent model at an introductory level, it doesn't tell the entire story.

There are several issues with the notion that electrons travel in a circular orbit around the nucleus, the main one being that they should eventually undergo orbital decay and hence eventually slow down and crash into the nucleus. Of course, this doesn't happen. So how do electrons move around the nucleus?
This is where quantum theory came to the rescue in the early 20th century. It stated that electrons could not be treated as a classical particle and didn't not have a definite position and momentum. So this basically means that we can't exactly know an electron's position and its momentum at the same time. This relationship is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. 
I won't go into detail about it since to keep this explanation basic, but if you are interested check out this video which provides a really good explanation.  
So basically what quantum theory tells us that we actually can't specify where and what a path an electron is going to take. However the Bohr model assumes that you can precisely plot out where an electron is going to be, but we now know that due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle you can’t precisely know the exact position and momentum of an electron. So we actually can't construct an orbit and say that the electron is always going to follow that path.
Therefore, it makes it impossible to plot an orbit for an electron as how can you? If you don’t know where the electron is going to be next, there is no way you can predict its path. 
So how can we get around this problem? Well, if we can’t draw the orbit for an electron the next best thing we can do is to plot an electron density probability orbital for it. Also known as atomic orbitals. 
An orbital is a well defined region of space. Therefore an atomic orbital is a region of space that shows where the electron will be 95% of the time (usually we take 95% but it could be any number really such as 90% or 75%). 
A simple way of thinking of orbitals is that imagine that you have a magic camera that can take a sequence of photos of an electron in a hydrogen atom. The electron appears as a dot. Now if we superimpose all of these images, you will see something like this:
 
Since we generally take atomic orbitals to be the region of space that shows where the electron will be 95% of the time, the very outer sphere of the above image is said to be the orbital of the electron.
Hopes this helps you understand orbitals. If you have any question, feel free to ask."
Chirality of symmetrically substituted biphenyl,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/65064/chirality-of-symmetrically-substituted-biphenyl,28k,"No, the biphenyl above is not chiral.
2,2′,6,6′-tetrasubstituted biphenyls are nonplanar at room temperature in order to avoid steric clashes between the substituents. This can in general give rise to chirality depending on the substituents, such as in this example.

However, this chirality is only true under certain conditions, namely:

The substituent groups must be sufficiently bulky in order to prevent rotation about the C–C single bond that connects the two rings. If this rotation occurs freely, then the two enantiomers will be able to interconvert, and chirality will not be observed (under typical conditions)

Both pairs of substituents on the phenyl rings must be non-identical; otherwise, the molecule will possess a plane of symmetry, rendering it achiral even if rotation about the C–C bond is restricted.


Here, since the two pairs of substituents on both rings are the same (i.e. two methyl groups on one ring, and two nitro groups on the other), the second criterion is not fulfilled. As a result, the molecule is not chiral."
Why is water a dipole?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/1107/why-is-water-a-dipole,38k,"Yep, it has to do with the orbitals.
$\ce{CO2}$ is linear, so even though the $\ce{C-O}$ bonds have individual dipole moments, the overall dipole moment is zero as these cancel out (they point in opposite directions, as shown in the diagram below).
On the other hand, $\ce{H2O}$ is ""bent"", which means that the individual dipole moments of the bond are at an angle to each other. They add up to give a net dipole moment (shown with grey in the diagram).

The colors indicate electron density, red is more dense/blue is less dense. Dipole moment is from low density to high density.
OK, so why do these molecules have differing shapes? This is where orbitals come in. I'll try to explain as much as I can without going into orbitals.
Carbon has an outer shell electronic configuration as $2s^22p^2$. Out of these four electrons, two are used in $\pi$ bonds, and two in $\sigma$ bonds. If you don't know what those are, just look at it like this for now: A set of bonds between two atoms will have one and only one $\sigma$ bond, with the rest of them $\pi$ bonds. So, any single bond is made up of just a $\sigma$ bond, a double bond is made up of one $\sigma$ and one $\pi$, and a triple bond is made up of one $\sigma$ and two $\pi$ bonds. What these types of bonds actually are can be explained if you know what an orbital is.
Now, what VSEPR says is that the geometry of the molecule is only decided by the $\sigma$ bonds and lone pairs on the central atom. You count up the $\sigma$ bonds and lone pairs (lets say they add up to $x$), and decide the geometry based on that. The geometry is the most stable configuration of $x$ hybrid orbitals. In simple terms, if we took $x$ balloons and tied them together, the directions the balloons point in help us correspond to where the bonds and lone pairs lie:

In $\ce{CO2}$, we have two $\sigma$ bonds and two $\pi$ bonds (as each double bond has one of each type). Each bond takes up one electron from carbon, so we have no leftover electrons for forming any lone pair. Since we have two $\sigma$ bonds and 0 lone pairs, $x=2$, giving us the structure given by the first set of balloons, which is linear. And $\ce{CO2}$ is indeed linear:

Now let's take water. The central atom (Oxygen) has a valence configuration of $2s^22p^4$, that is, 6 electrons. In water, since we have two single bonds, we have one $\sigma$ bond each (and no $\pi$ bonds). So we have total two $\sigma$ bonds.
But this leaves us with $6-2=4$ unpaired valence electrons. These form two ""lone pairs"" (pairs of electrons which do not bond). With two lone pairs and two $\sigma$ bonds, $x=4$. This gives us a tetrahedral structure (third in the balloon diagram). Two of the four points in the tetrahedron are occupied by the lone pairs, and two by bonds:

(Note that the angle 104.5 is not the same as the angle in perfect tetrahedra, 109.25--this is due to the lone pairs repelling each other)
So finally, we have the following ""bent"" structure for water:

From the structure, as shown above, it is very easy to check if the molecule has a dipole moment."
Why does diamond conduct heat better than graphite?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/12404/why-does-diamond-conduct-heat-better-than-graphite,45k,"Diamond is one of the best thermal conductors known, in fact diamond is a better thermal conductor than many metals (thermal conductivity (W/m-K): aluminum=237, copper=401, diamond=895).  The carbon atoms in diamond are $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized and every carbon is bonded to 4 other carbon atoms located at the vertices of a tetrahedron.  Hence the bonding in diamond is a uniform, continuous 3-dimensional network of $\ce{C-C}$ single (sigma) bonds.  Graphite on the other hand is formed from $\ce{sp^2}$ hybridized carbon atoms that form a continuous 2-dimensional sigma and pi bonding network.  This 2-dimensional network forms sheets of graphite, but there is little connection between the sheets, in fact, the sheet-sheet separation is a whopping ~3.4 angstroms.  This might lead us to suspect that heat conduction in the 2-dimensional sheet of graphite would be superior to diamond, but that heat conduction between graphite sheets would be very low.  This is, in fact, an accurate description of thermal conduction in graphite.  Thermal conductivity parallel to the graphite sheets=1950, but thermal conduction perpendicular to the sheet=5.7.  Therefor, when we consider thermal conduction over all possible directions (anisotropic) diamond would be superior to graphite."
"Is cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane a meso compound?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/61107/is-cis-1-2-dimethylcyclohexane-a-meso-compound,31k,"cis-1,2-Dimethylcyclohexane is achiral, not because there is a plane of symmetry, but because it consists of two enantiomeric conformations which interconvert rapidly via ring flipping at normal temperatures.
This is exactly the same case as amine inversion. ""Chiral nitrogens"" such as that in $\ce{NHMeEt}$ do not lead to chirality or optical activity because of rapid inversion of configuration at the nitrogen atom, leading to interconversion of the two enantiomeric forms 1a and 1b.

Likewise, the ring flip in cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane leads to two different conformers. I have deliberately chosen to depict the ring flip in the following fashion, to make the mirror image relationship more obvious. The green methyl group, equatorial in conformer 2a, is changed into an axial methyl group in conformer 2b. Likewise, the blue methyl group goes from axial to equatorial. The 1,2-cis relationship between the two methyl groups is retained in both conformers.

Each individual conformer can be said to be chiral, but just like how the amine is considered achiral, cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane as a whole is considered achiral.

Is the compound meso? According to the IUPAC Gold Book, a meso-compound is defined as:

A term for the achiral member(s) of a set of diastereoisomers which also includes one or more chiral members.

1,2-Dimethylcyclohexane possesses two diastereomers, one cis and one trans form. The trans form is chiral, but the cis form is achiral, as explained above. Therefore, the cis form satisfies the above definition and is considered a meso-compound."
Physical intuition behind negative values for wave function?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/35212/physical-intuition-behind-negative-values-for-wave-function,18k,"The wavefunction of a particle actually has no physical interpretation to it until an operator is applied to it such as the Hamiltonian operator, or if you square it which gives its probability of being at a certain place. So having a negative wavefunction doesn't mean anything physically. However, let's say for a particle in a box, if you solve the momentum operator for the $n^\text{th}$ stationary state, you would get two solutions: $+\hbar k$ and $-\hbar k$, where $k = n\pi/L$. The plus and minus signs mean that there is a $50$% chance the particle could be moving from the left to the right and a $50$% chance of the particle moving from right to left. 
In the case of summing of two wavefunctions to get the wavefunction of a molecular orbital, a negative wavefunction doesn't mean anything at all. The reason why when a positive and negative wavefunction is added, an antibonding orbital is formed is simply because when you add a positive and negative number, you get $0$ or a really small number. This is known as destructive interference.  Therefore the new wavefunction will contain a region where the y values equal $0$. So when you square this new wavefunction of the molecular orbital you are going to get that there is very 0 probability of finding the electron in that position (known as a nodal plane), and hence it is called an antibonding orbital.However note that just because there is negative region in the wavefunction, doesn't mean that it will always add to form an anti-bonding MO. For example, if you add 2 negative wavefunction values (known as constructive interference), you get a large negative value. When you square becomes a very large positive value. Hence this means that there is a large probability of the electron being in that region and hence it will be a bonding MO."
Bonding in the phosphate ion,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/13657/bonding-in-the-phosphate-ion,45k,"First of all, let me state the obvious: Phosphorus is awesome.
After we got that out of the way we can focus on why. 

There are many different modifications of phosphorus in nature. With increasing thermodynamic stability they are $$\ce{P_{white} -> P_{red} -> P_{violet} -> P_{black}}.$$
Apart from this there are many low molecular different allotropes, like $\ce{P4 (white)}$, $\ce{P6}$, $\ce{P8}$, $\ce{P10}$, $\ce{P12}$. And because that is not enough, there are chain like polymeric allotropes, too.
Apart from this it is possible to formulate many different cations and anions, that are derived from the above molecular structures. Just to name a few, there are $\ce{P3+, P5+, P7+, P9+}$ mainly observed in gaseous phase an $\ce{P^{3-},P2^{4-}, P3^{5-}, P4^{2-}, P7-,...,}$ usually in combination with alkali metals. Most amazingly it may form anionic polymer strains of the general form $\ce{[P7-]_{\infty}, [P15-]_{\infty}}$.
But now for the most important part, phosphorus has stable oxidation states in compounds, ranging from $\mathrm{-III}$ to $\mathrm{+V}$. Here are a few examples:
$$\ce{\overset{-III}{P}H3,\ \overset{-II}{P_2}H4,\ [\overset{-I}{P}H]_{n},\ \overset{\mathrm{\pm0}}{P4},\ H3\overset{\mathrm{+I}}{P}O2,\ H4\overset{\mathrm{+II}}{P2}O4,\ H3\overset{\mathrm{+III}}{P}O3,\ H2\overset{\mathrm{+IV}}{P2}O6,\ H3\overset{\mathrm{+V}}{P}O4}$$
While dealing with these compounds it is usually completely unnecessary to describe bonding with hybrid orbitals. 
In case of phosphane $\ce{PH3}$ it would be wrong. Assuming $\ce{{}^{sp^3}P}$ one would expect $\angle(\ce{H-P-H})\approx109^\circ$, while it is found to be $\angle(\ce{H-P-H})=93.5^\circ$, which is almost the same angle as the $\ce{p}$ orbitals are having towards each other.
In general your assumption is correct, that it is possible to form only three covalent bonds to reach a stable configuration. And that will most likely be the case when phosphorus forms compounds with more electropositive elements.
Now dealing with oxygen, means dealing with a much more electronegative element, i.e. $\ce{En(O)}\approx3.4$, $\ce{En(P)}\approx2.2$. That also means that bonds are much more polarised towards the oxygen.
Analysing the phosphate anion $\ce{PO4^{3-}}$ it is crucial to recognise its symmetry, which is tetrahedral $T_\mathrm{d}$. In this arrangement it is perfectly safe (but not at all necessary) to describe phosphorus as $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridised.
A Natural Bond Orbital analysis (BP86/def2-TZVPP) reveals that there are 4 equal $\ce{P-O}~\sigma$ single bonds and each oxygen has three lone pairs. The contribution of the $\ce{d}$ orbitals to bonding is well below $1\%$ and can be interpreted as numerical noise (use as polarisation functions) of the DFT method.
\begin{array}{rlrr}\hline
       &             &\mathrm{\%P (hyb)}  &\mathrm{\%O (hyb)}\\\hline
3\times&\ce{Bd(O-P)} & 24 (\ce{sp^3}) & 76 (\mathrm{sp^{2.3}})\\
       &\ce{Lp(O)}   &                & 100 (\mathrm{sp^{0.4}})\\
2\times&\ce{Lp(O)}   &                & 100 (\ce{p})\\\hline
\end{array}
This is consistent with the partial charges, i.e. $q(\ce{P})=2.2$, $q(\ce{O})=-1.3$. Therefore a more accurate Lewis formula is with charge separation.

The corresponding NBO reflect the bonding picture one would expect given all details from above. It should be noted, that natural bond orbitals are a linear combination of the canonical orbitals and do not have a physical meaningful energy eigenvalue.

Why do we get slightly more inversion product than retention product in SN1 reaction?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/86756/why-do-we-get-slightly-more-inversion-product-than-retention-product-in-sn1-reac,21k,"It is well known that SN1 reactions often give incomplete racemisation:

Although many first-order substitutions do give complete racemization, many others do not. Typically there is 5–20% inversion, although in a few cases, a small amount of retention of configuration has been found. These and other results have led to the conclusion that in many SN1 reactions at least some of the products are not formed from free carbocations but rather from ion pairs.

We can explain this by realising that the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms are not really discrete, as often taught, but rather two extremes of a 'mechanistic continuum'. This has implications for both the stereochemical outcome of many substitutions (i.e. proposed SN2 are not always as stereospecific as one might expect), and also the kinetics (i.e. measuring the rates of substitutions won't always give data consistent with purely SN2 or purely SN1 mechanisms).

At the SN1 extreme, there is no covalent interaction between the reactant and the incoming nucleophile during the transition state (TS) for the cleavage of the leaving group.
At the SN2 extreme, the TS has covalent interactions in which there is concerted formation of a new bond between the incoming nucleophile and the reactant , with cleavage of the bond to the leaving group.

This mechanistic continuum was first explained by Winstein, who studied both the kinetics and resulting stereochemistry of nucleophilic substitutions at saturated carbons.[1] This model is widely accepted, though rarely taught at the undergraduate level.
Winstein's theory proposes the presence of several additional intermediates along the reaction coordinate- these are known as 'ion pairs' and represent varying levels of association between the reagent and the leaving group. The energy levels between these ion pairs are small, and nucleophilic attack can occur at any stage (hence the continuum).


 Fig1: Winstein model for nucleophilic substitution. Taken from Carey's Advanced Organic Chemistry. Part A. /2
The Winstein model fits with what is commonly taught, namely that SN1 gives racemisation and SN2 gives inversion:

SN2  reactions occur when the nucleophile intercepts the contact ion pair and give stereospecific inversion of configuration since the leaving group is still associated with the carbocation, essentially shielding one face from attack
SN1 reactions occur when the nucleophile intercepts the fully dissociated free carbocation and gives complete racemisation as both faces of the planar carbocation are equally accessible

Which mechanism operates is largely determined by how stable the carbocation is. Primary carbocations are highly unstable and as such there is little (if no) dissociation. Tertiary cations are stable and as such complete dissociation can occur.
The interesting case is where nucleophilic attack occurs on a solvent separated ion pair - we see neither complete inversion nor complete racemisation, as some association still exists at this stage (partially, but not completely blocking one face of the cation).
Modern Physical Organic Chemistry[3] gives an overview of all of the possibilities, though the figure is a little hard to follow:

"Comparing the stabilities of allylic, benzylic, and tertiary radicals",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/26570/comparing-the-stabilities-of-allylic-benzylic-and-tertiary-radicals,34k,"This is a tough question.  I think it might even be unfair to ask such a question on a test in non-advanced classes.  In advanced classes it could make an interesting topic of discussion, but I'm still not sure that the ""real"" answer is known.
What can be said is that due to resonance, both the allylic and benzylic radicals are more stable than the t-butyl or ethyl radicals which are not resonance stabilized.  You can see from the following diagram that you can draw two resonance structures for the allyl radical.

For the benzyl radical you can draw even more resonance structures.

Superficially, this might suggest that the benzylic radical is more stable than the allyl radical. This was the ""answer"" and reasoning provided here.
However, if you do some thermochemical calculations (as done here), you arrive at the opposite conclusion that the allyl radical is roughly 2 kcal/mol more stable than the benzyl radical. The number of resonance structures alone is not a perfect indicator of stability.
For me, that is a pretty small difference in energy, and I think it would be fair to answer that the allyl and benzyl radicals have comparable stabilities."
What does lowercase r-s notation mean?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5597/what-does-lowercase-r-s-notation-mean,12k,"The name (1​s,4​s)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane is correct; it is even the preferred IUPAC name (PIN). It refers to the cis isomer of 1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane.

The preferred IUPAC name for the corresponding trans isomer is (1​r,4​r)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane.


In general nomenclature, according to Subsection P-93.5.1.2 of the current version of Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry – IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013 (Blue Book), the stereodescriptors 'cis' and 'trans' may be used to denote the relative configuration of substituted monocyclic compounds.

P-93.5.1.2 Relative configuration: the stereodescriptors 'cis' and 'trans'
The stereodescriptors 'cis' and 'trans' are used to show the relationship between two ligands (atoms or groups) attached to separate atoms that are contained in a ring or a ring system. The two ligands are said to be located 'cis' to each other if they lie on the same side of a plane. If they are on opposite sides, their relative position is described as 'trans'. The appropriate reference plane of a ring or ring system (the ring being in a conformation, real or assumed, without reentrant angles at the two substituted atoms) is the mean plane of the ring(s). The stereodescriptors denote relative configuration; the absolute configuration must be described by CIP stereodescriptors such as 'R' and 'S'.
(…)

In preferred IUPAC names, all stereogenic units shall be specified (unless an omission is explicitly allowed). The presence of stereogenic units does not require the molecule to be chiral.
According to Subsection P-93.5.1.1.1, the absolute configuration in substituted monocyclic compounds shall be described by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) stereodescriptors.

P-93.5.1.1.1 Absolute configuration
In substituted monocyclic compounds the absolute configuration is specified in preferred IUPAC names by the CIP stereodescriptors such as 'R', 'S', 'r', and 's'.

This rule explicitly applies to achiral cyclic compounds, too.

P-93.5.1.1.2 Achiral cyclic compounds
The configuration of achiral cyclic molecules is also specified by CIP stereodescriptors in preferred IUPAC names.
(…)

Therefore, this rule also applies to (1​s,4​s)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane, which is given in the question, and its isomer (1​r,4​r)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane. (The examples mentioned in the Blue Book include the similar compounds (1​s,4​s)-cyclohexane-1,4-diol, (1​r,4​r)-cyclohexane-1,4-diol, and (1​r,4​r)-4-chloro-4-methylcyclohexan-1-ol.)

The lower-case stereodescriptors 'r' and 's' are CIP stereodescriptors like 'R' and 'S'. The stereodescriptor 'r' or 's' is chosen by applying the CIP sequence rules as for the stereodescriptors 'R' and 'S'. However, the stereodescriptors 'r' and 's' are used to indicate the absolute configuration of pseudoasymmetric centers, whereas 'R' and 'S' are used to indicate the absolute configuration of real chirality centers.

P-91.2.1.1 Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) stereodescriptors
Some stereodescriptors described in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority system, called 'CIP stereodescriptors', are recommended to specify the configuration of organic compounds, (…), and in the nomenclature of natural products (…). The following stereodescriptors are used as preferred stereodescriptors (…):
(a) 'R' and 'S', to designate the absolute configuration of tetracoordinate (quadriligant) chirality centers;
(b) 'r' and 's', to designate the absolute configuration of pseudoasymmetric centers;
(…)

The 'pseudoasymmetric' is defined in Subsection P-92.1.1 (d) as follows.

Stereogenic units are called pseudoasymmetric (center, axis or plane) when they have distinguishable ligands 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', two and only two of which are nonsuperposable mirror images of each other (enantiomorphic). (…). The 'r/s' (…) stereodescriptors describing a pseudoasymmetric stereogenic unit are invariant on reflection in a mirror (for example 'r' remains 'r', and 's' remains 's'), but are reversed by the exchange of any two ligands ('r' becomes 's', and 's' becomes 'r'). Lower case stereodescriptors are used to describe pseudoasymmetric stereogenic units.

For example, (2​R,3​r,4​S)-2,3,4-trichloropentane contains two chirality centers (labeled 'R' and 'S', respectively) and one pseudoasymmetric center (labeled 'r').

The two 1-chloroethyl ligands of the pseudoasymmetric center are nonsuperposable mirror images of each other. On reflection of the entire molecule in a mirror, the configurations of the chirality centers are reversed ('R' becomes 'S', and 'S' becomes 'R'), but the configuration of the pseudoasymmetric center is invariant ('r' remains 'r').
The same principle applies to (1​s,4​s)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane, which is given in the question.

The two halves of the 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane are nonsuperposable mirror images of each other. Therefore, the compound contains two pseudoasymmetric centers, which are invariant on reflection in a mirror ('1​s,4​s' remains '1​s,4​s').

Although this case is explicitly mentioned in the Blue Book, it may not be obvious how to choose the stereodescriptors 'r' or 's' for 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexanes. The ranking is a complex process and requires the use of auxiliary descriptors.
Generally, the stereodescriptors 'r' and 's' are assigned by applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priority System as for the stereodescriptors 'R' and 'S'. The order of precedence is reached by the construction of a hierarchical digraph and the application of the Sequence Rules.
The constitutional formula of a cyclic molecule is transformed into an acyclic digraph according to the methodology that is described in Subsection P-92.1.4.3 and which has been recommended by Prelog and Helmchen.
In order to obtain the acyclic digraph of a stereogenic unit, the didentate ligand (i.e. the ring) is transformed into two monodentate ligands by leaving intact in each case one bond with the core of the stereogenic unit and cleaving the other bond. At the end of each of the two branches thus obtained, a duplicate atom of the core is attached. (Note that this methodology is similar to the case of multiple bonds.) For example, for the pseudoasymmetric stereogenic unit at the atom numbered '1' of (1​s,4​s)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane:

where $\ce{(C)}$ is a duplicate representation of the core of the pseudoasymmetric stereogenic unit.
As the digraph is acyclic, it is now possible to specify the stereodescriptor 'R' or 'S' for the stereogenic unit at the atom numbered '4', which is carrying the methyl group, in each branch. These are auxiliary descriptors that are different in each branch.

Since the auxiliary descriptors are different, they allow the branches to be ranked using Sequence Rule 5, which states that 'R' has priority over 'S'.

P-92.1.3.5 Sequence Rule 5
An atom or group with descriptor 'R', 'M', and 'seqCis' has priority over its enantiomorph 'S', 'P' or 'seq Trans'.

Therefore, the configuration of the pseudoasymmetric stereogenic unit at the atom numbered '1' of (1​s,4​s)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane can be determined to be 's'.

In the same way, the configuration of the pseudoasymmetric stereogenic unit at the atom numbered '4' of (1​s,4​s)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane can be determined as 's'.

Therefore, the complete configuration of (1​s,4​s)-1-ethyl-4-methylcyclohexane, which is given in the question, is indeed (1​s,4​s)."
Why does radium have a higher first ionisation energy than barium?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/2795/why-does-radium-have-a-higher-first-ionisation-energy-than-barium,19k,"I think it's also important to mention relativistic effects here.  They already start becoming quite visible after $Z=70$, and $\ce{Ra}$ lies a good bit after that.
In very heavy atoms, the electrons of the $\ce{1s}$ orbital (actually, all orbitals with some electron density close to the nucleus, but the $\ce{1s}$ orbital happens to be the closest and therefore most affected) are subjected to very high effective nuclear charges, compressing the orbitals into a very small region of space. This in turn forces the innermost electrons' momenta to be very high, via the uncertainty principle (or in a classical picture, the electrons need to orbit the nucleus very quickly in order to avoid falling in). The momenta are so high, in fact, that special relativity corrections become appreciable, so that the actual, relativistically corrected momenta, ($p_{\text{relativistic}}=\gamma p_{\text{classical}}$) are somewhat higher than the approximate classical momenta. Again via the uncertainty principle, this causes a relativistic contraction of the $\ce{1s}$ orbital (and other orbitals with electron density close to the nucleus, especially $\ce{ns}$ and $\ce{np}$ orbitals).
The relativistic contraction of the innermost orbitals creates a cascade of electron shielding changes among the rest of the orbitals. The final result is that all $\ce{ns}$ orbitals are contracted, getting closer to the nucleus and becoming shifted down in energy. This is relevant to the question because the $\ce{7s}$ valence electrons in $\ce{Ra}$ are more attracted to the nucleus than one would expect from a simple trend analysis, since they rarely take into account the increase of relativistic effects as one goes down the periodic table. 
Thus, the first (and second) ionization energy of $\ce{Ra}$ becomes higher than expected, to the point that there's actually a upward blip in the downward trend. Eka-radium ($Z=120$) would have far stronger relativistic effects, and can be expected to have a significantly higher ionization energy compared to $\ce{Ra}$. In fact, relativistic effects will conspire to make the group 2 metals slightly more noble! Though the periodic table becomes such a mess near the super heavy elements that it's hard to say whether it'll be a clearly visible trend, or just one effect to be combined with several others."
Why is acetic acid more acidic than phenol?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6155/why-is-acetic-acid-more-acidic-than-phenol,45k,"There are actually several factors that affect the stabilization of negative charge. The first is what kind of atom centers the charge can be delocalized on and the second factor is how many atom centers the charge can be delocalized on. The first factor is more important than the second. Just think it like quality is more important than quantity. Symmetry is another factor but not very important in your case.
Let's look at the ethanoic acid vs phenol case. In the acetate ion, the negative charge is delocalized on two oxygen atom centers, while in the phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalized on one oxygen and three carbon atom centers. Because oxygen is much more electronegative than carbon, the delocalization of negative charge over two oxygens is better than delocalization over one oxygen and three carbons. Quality beats quantity here.

If you have 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, because the strong election withdrawing chlorine atoms is helping carbon center to stabilize negative charge, it is a much stronger acid than phenol itself. This is an example of the inductive effect at work, as opposed to resonance."

How does a lone pair of a central atom affect the dipole moment?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/13907/how-does-a-lone-pair-of-a-central-atom-affect-the-dipole-moment,64k,"How does lone pair of a central atom affect the dipole moment?

There is no single answer to your question, let me explain.  Unlike a typical covalent bond where the electrons are shared between two nuclei and the electron density is spread out over the entire bond, in a lone pair the electrons are not shared and the electron density is more localized around the atom that has the lone pair of electrons.  This increased electron density could lead to a more significant contribution from the lone pair electrons to the molecular dipole moment than from electrons spread out more diffusely in a covalent bond.  Next we must understand the directionality of the lone pair of electrons.  Consider the two molecules pictured below, ammonia and phosphine.  The molecules appear to be very similar, they are in the same column in the Periodic Table.

However in ammonia the $\ce{H-N-H}$ angle is around 107 degrees and the molecule is roughly $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized, the lone pair and the 3 $\ce{N-H}$ bonds roughly pointing towards the corners of a tetrahedron.  You can see that in this case (as shown by the arrows, the ""arrowhead"" end representing the negative end of a dipole), the lone pair on nitrogen will make a contribution to the molecular dipole moment.  Next, let's examine phosphine.  The $\ce{H-P-H}$ angle is around 90 degrees and the molecule can be viewed as being unhybridized, the lone pair is an $\ce{s}$ orbital and the 3 $\ce{P-H}$ bonds are constructed from phosphorous $\ce{p}$ orbitals.  You can see that in this case, the lone pair on phosphorous, due to its spherical symmetry will not make a contribution to the overall molecular dipole moment.  
So in summary, a lone pair of electrons can make a significant contribution to the magnitude of a molecular dipole moment due to the fact that they are more localized than bonding electrons and consequently there is a high electron density.  But, the directionality (or lack thereof) of the lone pair must also be assessed, since a lack of directionality may preclude it from making a significant contribution to the overall molecular dipole moment."
How are the number of tetrahedral voids twice the number of octahedral voids in a CCP structure?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/68859/how-are-the-number-of-tetrahedral-voids-twice-the-number-of-octahedral-voids-in,61k,"To be precise, if in a close packed structure (ccp or fcc) there are $n$ atoms or ions then the number of octahedral voids and tetrahedral voids will be $n$ and $2n$ respectively.
For example, there are 8 tetrahedral voids per unit cell of fcc structure $(Z_{\text{eff}}=4)$. If you divide the FCC unit cell into 8 small cubes then each small cube has 1 tetrahedral void located at its own body center. Thus, total number of TVs in a unit cell $= 8 = 2  \times  Z_\text{eff}$

Now, again consider a CCP or FCC unit cell. The body centre of the cube is not occupied but it is surrounded by 6 atoms (4 in same plane, 1 above and 1 below). On joining these face centers, an octahedral void is formed. Thus, number of OV at body centre of the cube is 1.

Besides the body center, there is one OV at the center of each of the 12 edges. It is surrounded by 6 atoms, three belonging to the same cell unit (two on the corners and once on face center), and the three belonging to two adjacent unit cells.

Since, each edge of the cube is shared between four adjacent unit cells only one fourth of each void belongs to a particular unit.
Therefore, OV at body centre = 1
OV at the 12 edges of the cube and shared between four unit cells  $= 12\times\frac{1}{4}=3$

Stability Comparison between the Tropylium and Tricyclopropylcarbinyl Carbocation,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/48264/stability-comparison-between-the-tropylium-and-tricyclopropylcarbinyl-carbocatio,24k,"It seems likely that the tricyclopropylcarbinyl carbocation would be more stable than the tropylium carbocation for the reasons I'll outline below, but if you have a reference proving this point, it would be nice to add it to your question.
Background
The cyclopropyl group is similar to an olefinic double bond in that it is very effective at stabilizing adjacent positive charge. The reason for this is that the $\ce{C-C}$ bonds in a cyclopropane ring are close to being $\mathrm{sp^4}$ hybridized (see this earlier answer for further elaboration of this point), said differently, there is a lot of p-character in the bond. In fact, the p-character is high enough that a cyclopropane compound will absorb bromine much like an olefin. If that cyclopropane high p-character bond (orbital) can align itself with the p-orbital on the adjacent carbocation center, it will stabilize the carbocation, just like a p-orbital on an adjacent double bond (the allyl system) stabilizes a carbocation.
Hart and Sandri [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959, 81 (2), 320–326] studied the solvolysis of the following 3 compounds (Ar = p-nitrophenyl) and found that the relative rates of solvolysis were 1 : 246 : 23,500.

The corresponding tricyclopropyl p-nitroester could not be synthesized, so to complete the series Hart and Law [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964, 86 (10), 1957–1959] prepared the analogous phenyl esters and found the relative rates of solvolysis to be 1 : 1,080. 

Clearly, every time a cycloproyl group is added significant additional stabilization of the carbocation center occurs.
Answer
The number of substituents stabilizing an adjacent positive charge is critical in determining the stability of a carbocation. Just as the trityl carbocation is much more stable than the benzyl carbocation, we see above that the  tricyclopropylcarbinyl carbocation is much more stable than the cyclopropylcarbinyl carbocation. Three stabilizing substituents are better than two substituents which is better than one.
In the tropylium carbocation there are 2 double bonds and a hydrogen stabilizing the carbocation center.  In the tricyclopropylcarbinyl carbocation there are 3 cyclopropyl groups stabilizing the carbocation center. Three groups provide  better stabilization than two groups, hence we might expect the tricyclopropylcarbinyl carbocation to be more stable than the tropylium carbocation.
A Word about Resonance Structures
The number of significant resonance structures for the tropylium cation is 7, the positive charge can be delocalized to each of the seven carbons as shown below. However 7 resonance structures can also be drawn for the tricyclopropylcarbinyl carbocation. So actually both carbocations have the same number of resonance structures."
Thermodynamic stability of meta-xylene over ortho- and para-isomers,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/89747/thermodynamic-stability-of-meta-xylene-over-ortho-and-para-isomers,10k,"The thermodynamic stability of m-xylene over o-xylene or p-xylene can be deduced by considering the hyperconjugative effect. More specifically, resonance forms with a positive charge on methyl-substituted carbons are more important than resonance forms with a negative charge on them, as the methyl group stabilises the positively charged carbon by hyperconjugation.
In the o- or p- isomers, the hyperconjugation of one methyl group produces negative charge at ortho and para position where another methyl group resides. This is highly destabilising. But, in the m-isomer, hyperconjugation does not destabilise the structure and both methyl groups' hyperconjugation effects act in a cooperative way with each other."
Why doesn't the SeO2 oxidation of ketones stop at the hydroxyketone stage?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33034/why-doesnt-the-seo2-oxidation-of-ketones-stop-at-the-hydroxyketone-stage,16k,"As noted in the cited paper by Sharpless and Gordon$^{[1]}$, the problem with the Corey$-$Schaefer mechanism is the existence of the selenous ester (7) which, due to its instability, would undergo hydrolysis prior to any elimination reaction.
A study by Qingjiang Li and Tochtrop$^{[2]}$ supports Sharpless and Gordon's counterargument. The former pair give a good overview of the hypotheses put forward up to that point (i.e., 2014).

$\beta$-hydrogen transfer (Speyer mechanism)


Based on the logic of the proposed mechanism, we reasoned that replacement of $\beta$-hydrogens of the substrate with deuterium would result in a ﬁrst-order
isotope eﬀect in the reaction rate.


Consequently, a $\beta$-deuterated fatty acid was prepared ... and converted to triﬂuoromethyl ketone to react with selenium dioxide. The reaction rate was monitored by NMR and compared with that of the analogous fatty acid without deuterium.$^{[2]}$

Based on this experiment, Li and Tochtrop conclude$^{[2]}$,

No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in reaction rates was observed, which suggested that the removal of $\beta$-hydrogen to form a carbon−carbon double bond is not likely to be the rate-limiting step, and we therefore excluded the $\beta$-hydrogen transfer mechanism.

Verdict: not the best explanation.

Sharpless$-$Gordon

While solving the selenous ester controversy, Li and Tochtrop found other problems introduced by Sharpless and Gordon.

[A]dding acid should accelerate the Sharpless mechanism by accelerating the enol−ketone tautomerization, as the rate limiting step is electrophilic attack of selenium dioxide to the enol. Since no signiﬁcant increase of the reaction rate was observed when adding acetic acid to the reaction mixture, the Corey−Schaefer mechanism seemed more reasonable.$^{[2]}$

To additionally verify this result,

$1.2$ equivalents of $\ce{Ti(O^iPr)4}$, a strong Lewis acid to coordinate with the carbonyl group, was added to the triﬂuoromethyl ketone for $1\ \mathrm{h}$ prior to selenium dioxide addition. This experiment resulted in no reaction, which subsequently served as further evidence that the reaction initiates with the ketone instead of the enol.$^{[2]}$

The Sharpless$-$Gordon mechanism also fails to explain some products detected in Li and Tochtrop's work with carboxylic acids.$^{[2]}$
Verdict: not the best explanation.

Corey$-$Schaefer

Verdict: not the best explanation due to the selenous ester intermediate.$^{[1]\ [2]}$
New mechanism proposed by Li and Tochtrop
Li and Tochtrop came up with a fourth mechanism to account for experimental evidence. Here, the reaction initiates via the ketone. The further pathway is dictated by whether $1$,$4$-elimination is restricted.$^{[2]}$
Li and Tochtrop examplify their mechanism with a trifluoromethylketone that has varying radicals attached to the non-fluorinated $\alpha$-carbon.$^{[2]}$
$\hskip 1 in$ 

As shown in Scheme $5$, we propose that high valence selenium reacts with
triﬂuoromethyl ketone to form the enol ester $(\bf{17})$. The enol ester undergoes $1$,$4$-elimination directly instead of nucleophilic attack of the carbon−carbon double bond to form selenium ester.$^{[2]}$


[---] When $1$,$4$-elimination is restricted, nucleophilic attack at the $\alpha$-position occurs and the subsequent hydrolysis of selenium($\mathrm{II}$) ester $(\bf{18})$ aﬀords alcohol as the product instead of enone.$^{[2]}$

In the context of the Li$-$Tochtrop mechanism, we can thus answer OP's original question.

The $\alpha$-hydroxyketone (10) is not observed. Why is that so?

The intermediate (4) has a small hydrogen attached to the original $\alpha$-carbon. In other words, $\ce{R2 = H}$. The $1$,$4$-elimination is not restricted. Hence, nucleophilic attack of the $\ce{C=C}$-bond does not take place.
The mechanism by Li and Tochtrop is also useful because it explains, to an extent, the dependence of the end product upon the starting material. Solvent and $\mathrm{pH}$ effects still have to be considered, and the pathway that yields diketones is not covered.

The nature of the starting material seems to have a great influence on the course of the reaction but usually one of the two types of compounds can be specifically obtained by using the right solvent. For example, dioxane favors the formation of the dione whereas t-butanol favors the unsaturated carbonyl compound.$^{[3]}$

Solutions of Group 1 and Group 2 metals in Ammonia,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/82874/solutions-of-group-1-and-group-2-metals-in-ammonia,11k,"As per P. Bahadur's Objective Chemistry 1st Year Program for IIT-JEE and All Other Engineering Entrance Examinations, under the chapter ""s-Block Elements - The Alkaline Earth Metals"", under Solubility in Liquid Ammonia, it reads:

Like Alkali Metals, alkaline earth metals also dissolve in liquid ammonia and form coloured solutions. When such a solution is evaporated, hexa-ammoniate, $\ce{M(NH3)6}$ is formed, which slowly decomposes to amides.
  $$\ce{M(NH3)6 -> M(NH2)2 + 4NH3 +H2}$$

(I noticed that it is almost exactly the same as JD Lee's Concise Inorganic Chemistry text.)
So far, it doesn't specify whether this metal $\ce{M}$ is only Beryllium or is the representation of the other alkaline earth metals as well... Since this is the case, I can safely assume that this applies to all the alkaline earth metals, and not just beryllium.
Another point mentioned in the book by Bahadur, under the chapter ""s-Block Elements - The Alkali Metals"", under Complex Ion Formation is that the Group 1 metals, i.e., the alkali earth metals have a larger size, low nuclear charge and hence don't tend to form complexes too easily. On the other hand, the Alkaline Earth metals are smaller, have higher nuclear charge, and hence, have a greater tendency to accept electrons, forming complexes. In Bahadur's Book, under ""s-Block Elements - The Alkaline Earth Metals"", under Formation of Complexes, he writes that:

However, $\ce{Be^{2+}}$ on account of smaller size forms many complexes such as $\ce{BeF3-}$, $\ce{BeF4^{2-}}$ and $\ce{Be(H2O)4^{2+}}$. Of the others, only $\ce{Mg}$ and $\ce{Ca}$ show much tendency to form complexes in solution and these are usually with oxygen donor ligands.

$\ce{NH3}$ is a ligand, and hence acts as a powerful complexing agent. This is why the $\ce{NH3}$ coordinates with these metals, forming hexa-ammoniates.

Hypothetical: What happens to water as pressure increases to infinity? [duplicate],https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/20009/hypothetical-what-happens-to-water-as-pressure-increases-to-infinity,22k,"Ron's answer gives us a good idea of what might happen in terms of ""normal"" chemistry, but if you really mean ""increases to infinity"", some very strange stuff happens. Suffice it to say, it doesn't stay water after a certain point. The intense temperatures created by the compression will cause the water to break apart, eventually no longer even having oxygen atoms due to nuclear reactions. Because we're talking about an externally applied pressure, the Chandrasekhar limit doesn't apply, so there is a point at which electrons and protons combine (when the electron degeneracy pressure is overcome) and a mass of neutrons remains. Neutrons themselves also have a degeneracy pressure (though we don't have good models to predict the exact pressure that has to be overcome). From here, we don't know what happens with as much certainty, but the formation of quark matter has been predicted. 
Eventually, we reach a singularity. We can think of this as all the matter we had before being compressed into an infinitesimal volume with infinite density and our applied pressure ceases to mean anything. If we started with enough water, this would behave much like any other black hole, though micro black holes are hypothesized to have some special properties."
Is there such a thing as an acid without a hydrogen?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/71852/is-there-such-a-thing-as-an-acid-without-a-hydrogen,30k,"It depends on which definition of acids and bases you are using. 
According to the Arrhenius theory, acids are defined as a compound or element that releases hydrogen (H+) ions into the solution. Therefore, there are no Arrhenius acids without a hydrogen atom.
According to the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, an acid is any substance that can donate a proton and a base as any substance that can accept a proton. Hence, there are no acids without a hydrogen atom according to this theory.
But according to the Lewis theory of acids and bases, an acid is any substance that can accept a pair of nonbonding electrons. In other words, a Lewis acid accepts a lone pair of electrons. According to this theory, acids without a hydrogen atom can exist. (A coordinate bond is formed between the Lewis acid and base. The compound formed by the Lewis acid and base is called a Lewis adduct)
A great example of this would be $\ce{BF3}$. It is neither an Arrhenius acid nor a Brønsted–Lowry acid but it is a Lewis acid. The boron atom accepts a pair of nonbonding electrons from another atom or ion to complete its octet. Here $\ce{BF3}$ is a Lewis acid as it accepts a pair of nonbonding electrons. 

The fluorine ion here is a Lewis base as it donates a pair of electrons.
If you want to get more rigorous about the definition of Lewis acids: ""a Lewis acid is a type of chemical that reacts with a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct"".

What does the circle inscribed in a benzene ring represent?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/46942/what-does-the-circle-inscribed-in-a-benzene-ring-represent,17k,"The circle, if anything, represents the inability of our everyday physical intuition to cope with the quantum phenomena. See, you would often encounter those two pictures with ""double bonds this way"" and ""double bonds that way"", intended to give a vague impression that the molecule switches quickly between the two, but that's not true.

It does not switch; it just stays there, in some sense ""halfway between"" these structures. There is no movement of double bonds, and in fact there are no double bonds. (Also, there is no movement of electrons either. They just sit there on their molecular orbitals, which by itself is an approximation, though a pretty decent one). All $\ce{C-C}$ bonds in benzene are the same; they are neither double nor ordinary. Read the Wikipedia page on aromaticity, or just look at this picture from it:

That's what the circle stands for."
Why does the energy gap for π - π* transitions shrink with the size of the pi-conjugated system?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/8910/why-does-the-energy-gap-for-%cf%80-%cf%80-transitions-shrink-with-the-size-of-the-pi-co,39k,"Klaus Warzecha's answer pretty much answers your question. But I know that this subject is easier to understand if supported by some pictures. That's why I will take the same route as Klaus at explaining the concept behind why the absorption in conjugated systems is shifted to higher wavelengths but I will provide some pictures on the way.
In a conjugated carbon chain or ring system you can think of the $\ce{C}$ atoms as $\text{sp}^{2}$-hybridized. So, each carbon has 3 $\text{sp}^{2}$ orbitals which it uses to form $\sigma$ bonds and 1 $\text{p}$ orbital which is used to form $\pi$ bonds.
It is the $\text{p}$ orbitals that are responsible for the conjugation and their combinations according to the LCAO model are the interesting part since the HOMO and LUMO of the system will be among the molecular orbitals formed from the conjugated $\text{p}$ orbitals.
For a start take ethene, the simplest $\pi$-system, being comprised of only 2 carbon atoms.
When you combine two atomic orbitals you get two molecular orbitals.
These result from combining the $\text{p}$ orbitals either in-phase or out-of-phase.
The in-phase combination is lower in energy than the original $\text{p}$ orbitals and the out-of-phase combination is higher in energy than the original $\text{p}$ orbitals.
The in-phase combination accounts for the bonding molecular orbital ($\pi$), whilst the out-of-phase combination accounts for the antibonding molecular orbital ($\pi^{*}$).

Now, what happens when you lengthen the conjugated system by combining two ethene fragments?
You get to butadiene.
Butadiene has two $\pi$ bonds and so four electrons in the $\pi$ system.
Which molecular orbitals are these electrons in?
Since each molecular orbital can hold two electrons, only the two molecular orbitals
lowest in energy are filled.
Let's have a closer look at these orbitals.
In $\Psi_1$, the lowest-energy bonding orbital, the electrons are spread out over all four carbon atoms (above and below the plane) in one continuous orbital.
There is bonding between all the atoms.
The other two electrons are in $\Psi_2$.
This orbital has bonding interactions between carbon atoms 1 and 2, and also between 3 and 4 but an antibonding interaction between carbons 2 and 3.
Overall, in both the occupied $\pi$ orbitals there are electrons between carbons 1 and 2 and between 3 and 4, but the antibonding interaction between carbons 2 and 3 in $\Psi_2$ partially cancels out the bonding interaction in $\Psi_1$.
This explains why all the bonds in butadiene are not the same and why the middle bond is more like a single bond while the end bonds are double bonds.
If we look closely at the coefficients on each atom in orbitals $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, it can be seen that the bonding interaction between the central carbon atoms in $\Psi_1$ is greater than the antibonding one in $\Psi_2$.
Thus butadiene does have some double bond character between carbons 2 and 3, which explains why there is the slight barrier to rotation about this bond.

You can construct the molecular orbitals of butadiene by combining the molecular orbitals of the two ethene fragments in-phase and out-of-phase.

This method of construction also shows why the HOMO-LUMO gap of butadiene is smaller than that of ethene.
The molecular orbital $\Psi_2$, which is the HOMO of butadiene, is the out-of-phase combination of two ethene $\pi$ orbitals, which are the HOMO of ethene.
Thus, the HOMO of butadiene is higher in energy than the HOMO of ethene.
Furthermore, the molecular orbital $\Psi_3$, which is the LUMO of butadiene, is the in-phase combination of two ethene $\pi^{*}$ orbitals, which are the LUMO of ethene.
Thus, the LUMO of butadiene is lower in energy than the LUMO of ethene.
It follows that the HOMO-LUMO energy gap is smaller in butadiene than in ethene and thus butadiene absorbs light with longer wavelenghts than ethene.

If you continue to lengthen the $\pi$ system by adding more ethene fragments you will see that the HOMO and LUMO are getting closer and closer together the longer the $\pi$ system becomes."
Please explain why dioxygen difluoride is so dangerous,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/4624/please-explain-why-dioxygen-difluoride-is-so-dangerous,14k,"XKCD's source material is an article from the blog of one of the funnier chemists I've read, Dr. Derek Lowe. The chemical in question made his ""Things I Won't Work With"" list, and the article is found here.
Dioxygen difluoride, $\ce{O_2F_2}$, sometimes evocatively labeled according to its atomic arrangement $\ce{FOOF}$, is first and foremost a vigorous oxidizer; in plain English, it starts roaring fires with almost anything it touches, even with things that simply will not burn in any other circumstances, like sand, concrete, brick, iron, copper, even asbestos and fiberglass. Both the oxygen and the fluorine are pretty highly electronegative (fluorine is the most electronegative element in the table, and oxygen's #2), and so they will readily react with anything even slightly more willing to donate an electron; carbon, silicon, metals, alkalis, most other gases, etc. When that happens, the high-energy bonds of this molecule (it can only be formed at 700*C, and that thermal energy remains ""locked"" in the structure of the molecule) are rearranged into structures that require less energy, and the excess energy is released. The resulting rapid, aggressive, highly exothermic reaction of dioxygen difluoride with just about any other material would not be described as anything less than an explosion.
Second, even in the absence of something to oxidize, the oxygen would much rather exist in its ""native"" diatomic gas state. Again, there's a lot of energy tied up in the molecular bonds of this chemical, and the lower the energy required to form a bond, the more stable the molecule. Therefore, even at extremely cold temperatures (-160*C) in complete isolation, dioxygen difluoride decomposes to oxygen difluoride ($\ce{OF_2}$) and $\ce{O_2}$ gas. At room temperature, this decomposition is uncontrollable (no-one's gotten it anywhere close to RT without it coming apart), and even at extremely cold temperatures, the heat produced by slow decomposition can cause what's called a ""thermal runaway""; the heat produced by one molecule decomposing is absorbed by nearby molecules causing them to decompose, releasing more heat, and so on. When things rapidly decompose into more stable gaseous components, the event is normally accompanied by a loud noise and shrapnel, formed from the remains of whatever had been holding the substance and anything else nearby.
Of the products formed by the self-decomposition of FOOF, oxygen gas is a pretty strong oxidizer, but it's the least of our worries here. The other product, oxygen difluoride, is almost as strong an oxidizer as dioxygen difluoride, which is only stronger because it's oxygen difluoride plus more oxygen. The ""shared"" electron pairs forming the bonds between the oxygen and each fluorine atom are much more closely attracted to the fluorine, as opposed to a structure like water where the oxygen is the more attractive. This gives the oxygen a formally positive oxidation state of +2. 
By its very nature, oxygen yearns to flip that sign and achieve its ""natural"" -2 ox state by bonding with something less electronegative (which, as previously mentioned, is almost everything else in the periodic table besides fluorine). However, unlike the other oxygen atom in the FOOF molecule which flew the coop, this second oxygen can't escape, because the two fluorine atoms won't let it go. The fluorines prefer to bond to it rather than to each other... until something else, anything else, is introduced that's even more attractive. 
$\ce{OF_2}$, like its FOOF parent, reacts very strongly and exothermically with almost anything, especially water. It will literally burn ice, rapidly; that's one of the reactions guaranteed to produce a powerful explosion. The most stable ultimate products of that reaction are hydrogen fluoride gas and more oxygen, and when you call HF gas a ""stable"" product of any reaction you are speaking in very relative terms; a release of HF gas into the air is one of those ""drop everything and run"" types of industrial accidents. HF gas dissolves in water, including the mucus of your lungs, to produce hydrofluoric acid, a persistent, toxic, corrosive acid that will shred just about any organic chemical it comes across from hemoglobin to proteins to DNA, and you really want to keep those kinds of things intact.
Basically, there are a lot of things in an inorganic chemistry lab that have a Medusa-like ability to kill at a glance, but fluorine deserves special notice, in part because of the number of notable chemists who were poisoned or blown up in the early heady days of isolating it. When you combine it with other elements on the right hand side of the periodic table in ""lightweight"" combinations (between two and about ten atoms per molecule), your day is about to get reeeeealy interesting; see the work of A.G. Streng, who was tasked not only with producing large quantities of dioxygen difluoride, but also with reacting it with things that normal chemists would keep very far away from it (and in fact ""normal chemists"" stay very far away from FOOF itself for the obvious reasons). 
Fluorine only starts becoming more stable and easier to work with as an ionic salt, such as sodium or calcium fluoride (in which form it naturally occurs as the mineral fluorite; still poisonous in sufficient doses but much less of an explosion/reactivity hazard), or when you start throwing in elements of the carbon group (the carbon-fluorine bond is among the strongest known to chemistry, and fluorocarbons have a variety of uses as propellants, refrigerants and polymers, including Teflon), or heavier chalcogens like sulfur (sulfur hexafluoride, $\ce{SF_6}$, has virtually no reaction chemistry and is favored as a dielectric and to blanket air-sensitive materials, though other sulfur-fluoride compounds like sulfur tetrafluoride and disulfur decafluoride are highly toxic)."
Can other substances be dissolved in a saturated solution?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/72700/can-other-substances-be-dissolved-in-a-saturated-solution,18k,"Saturating a liquid with one solute does not mean that the liquid will no longer dissolve another solute. However, you can expect the solubility of the second solute to be different, generally lower, than in the neat solvent.  
One relevant concept here (though not specifically applicable to sucrose), in the case of ionic solutes, is the common-ion effect. According to this Wikipedia article:  

The common ion effect is responsible for the reduction in the solubility of an ionic precipitate when a soluble compound containing one of the ions of the precipitate is added to the solution in equilibrium with the precipitate. It states that if the concentration of any one of the ions is increased, then, according to Le Chatelier's principle, some of the ions in excess should be removed from solution, by combining with the oppositely charged ions.  

Regardless of whether the solute is ionic or not, when you are given a solubility value, for example, the solubility of some compound in water as $\pu{g solute/100mL water}$, this value is only relevant to the solubility in pure water. Once you have saturated water with sucrose, you then have a very different solvent system. There are no simple means of determining what the solubility of a particular solute will be in a solution saturated with another solute. However, there will, in general, be some solubility of additional solvents except as in the case described for the common ion effect.

Why can't rust form without water?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5134/why-cant-rust-form-without-water,42k,"We could explain it from an electrolytic point of view.
Iron has a certain tendency to dissolve in water according to the following equation:
$\ce{Fe (s) -> Fe^2+ (aq) + 2e^-}$
The release of electrons causes a small current to flow in the metal (Remember that metals conduct electricity). This turns the point where iron dissolves into an anode, and the region around this area becomes rich in electrons, a cathode. Now, we have to remember that water dissociates to small extents according to:
$\ce{H2O (l) <=> H^+ (aq) + OH^- (aq)}$
If it was an acid, the $\ce{H^+}$ would have quickly taken all the electrons liberated from the dissolution of iron earlier, but the concentration of hydrogen ions is not large enough in water, so that we get another reaction taking place at the cathode [The hydrogen ions actually 'gather up' near to the surface but cannot do anything, creating a thin protective layer of hydrogen ions around the cathode, but not strong enough to prevent further reaction]. This reaction involves oxygen and other water molecules:
$\ce{2H2O (l) + O2 (g) + 4e^- -> 4OH^- (aq)}$
Now this is the $\ce{OH^-}$ that reacts with the earlier liberated iron (or ferrous) ions:
$\ce{Fe^2+ (aq) + 2OH^- (aq)->Fe(OH)2 (aq)}$
Now more oxygen will react to oxidise the iron (II) hydroxide...
$\ce{Fe(OH)2 (aq) \xrightarrow[O] Fe(OH)3 (aq) \xrightarrow[O] Fe2O3 (s)}$
You probably can recognise the last product.
As the $\ce{Fe^2+}$ are consumed, more iron will get dissolved (Le Chatelier's Principle) and keep the whole process going.
Maybe a little picture to go along with this :)"
Can heteroatoms with lone pairs be chiral centres?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/50106/can-heteroatoms-with-lone-pairs-be-chiral-centres,14k,"Generally, amine nitrogens will not behave like a normal asymmetric carbon. Simple amines are roughly $\mathrm{sp^3}$ hybridiized and the molecules you use as examples do have 4 (we include the lone pair of electrons as a substituent) different substituents around the central nitrogen atom. So in principle me might consider it asymmetric or chiral.  But simple amines can undergo a process called nitrogen inversion, which essentially coverts one enantiomer into the other.


(image source)
However, if one can find a way to slow down or eliminate the nitrogen inversion process, then chiral amines can be isolated. One way to achieve this is to incorporate the amine nitrogen into a 3-membered ring (an aziridine). Now to achieve the planar state necessary for nitrogen inversion requires the bond angle in the 3-membered ring to open from 60° to 120°, an impossible task. Aziridines containing a chiral nitrogen atom have been isolated and characterized."
Is it possible to melt diamonds into a liquid?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6834/is-it-possible-to-melt-diamonds-into-a-liquid,87k,"Liquid carbon does indeed exist, but perhaps surprisingly, relatively little is known about it. It only exists above around $4000\ \mathrm{K}$ and $100\ \mathrm{atm}$, which are not trivial conditions to sustain and probe. There certainly are many theoretical studies into the properties of liquid carbon, though. You can find a phase diagram for carbon here, though it is likely just a rough guide. The specific bonding properties of carbon atoms in the liquid phase still seems uncertain to some extent because carbon is very versatile and can create very dissimilar structures (easily seen comparing its two most common phases, graphite and diamond). This source suggests that bonding in the liquid varies continuously between linear acetylenic chains, graphite-like and diamond-like structures, depending on the exact conditions.
Edit: Now I realize that obtaining liquid carbon and melting diamonds are two slightly different things. Liquid carbon is trivial to obtain compared to melting a diamond. As you mention, heating diamond at relatively low pressures will cause it to convert into graphite before it could melt. The only way to inhibit that would be to exploit the slight difference in density between graphite and diamond; as diamond is denser, the increased pressure will stabilize it slightly, decreasing the tendency for diamond to revert back to graphite.
You'll need a lot of pressure though! Rigorously speaking, according to the phase diagram above, to obtain liquid carbon directly from melting a diamond would require a pressure of at least $10\ \mathrm{GPa}$, which is about $10^5\ \mathrm{atm}$. To put that into perspective, it's about $1/30$ of the pressure at the centre of the Earth. Amazingly, we actually can reach such absurd pressures in the lab by compressing two diamonds against each other. However, if the conditions required conditions for melting diamond (and sustaining it in molten form) are reached, it would probably compromise the integrity of the instrument and cause catastrophic (possibly explosive) failure, so I don't think anyone will be purposefully melting diamonds any time soon! Other techniques could be used (laser inertial confinement, light-gas guns, etc), but I believe most would only transiently produce liquid diamond."
Why are Silicates solid while carbon dioxide is a gas?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34591/why-are-silicates-solid-while-carbon-dioxide-is-a-gas,85k,"The reason why carbon dioxide is a gas and silicon dioxide is a solid is because their chemical structures are different.
Carbon dioxide is a linear structure with two double bonds between carbon and oxygen. It is a small molecule and non-polar with only weak bonds between the molecules. Hence it is a gas.
Silicon dioxide is not formed of small molecules. It consists of an infinite array of silicons where each silicon is bonded to four separate oxygens (and each oxygen is shared between two silicons). This creates a strong refractory solid (glass and sand are mostly silicon dioxide aka silica). So the same apparent overall formula doesn't describe the actual structure of the compounds at all. But the structures explain the difference in behaviour.
Of course this doesn't explain why silicon prefers to bond with four oxygens when carbon prefers just two. This is not completely simple and results from the relative bond strengths of carbon-oxygen bonds, carbon-oxygen double bonds and the equivalent bonds for silicon and oxygen. The simple version is that silicon oxygen bonds are strong relative to their double-bond equivalents whereas carbon-oxygen double bonds are strong relative to their single bond equivalents. Or, more precisely, if we could make a carbon-oxygen network solid with the equivalent structure to silica, it would tend to fall apart into carbon dioxide. If we could make silicon dioxide molecules, they would react with the release of energy to give silica. 
Deeper explanations would need to look at why the relative strengths of double and single bonds turn out that way, but that would get into molecular quantum mechanics and would not be much more useful as an explanation.
The simplest explanation is the fact that the structures are different."
Platinum group metals: Why are platinum and palladium great catalysts and not the others?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34145/platinum-group-metals-why-are-platinum-and-palladium-great-catalysts-and-not-th,19k,"I think some of the other transition elements have also catalytic properties. For example, rhodium is generally used in addition to platinum or palladium in catalytic converters to oxidize carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons on one hand, and reduce $\ce{NO_x}$ to nitrogen on the other hand.
So, the choice is often made on the basis of relative cost.
But of course, not all transition elements are adequate for these catalytic properties: 

Metals such as silver and copper have a high affinity for sulfur and form metal sulfides and sulfates. As this happens, there will be progressively less metal available to function as a catalyst. While platinum tends not to become totally or irreversibly poisoned, i.e It can be efficiently recycled.
Another point is linked to ""Tammann temperatures"" of these metallic elements:  Actually, in a catalytic converter, metal is used in the form of nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of a porous support material. When  temperature increases the particles starts to becomes mobile and coalesce (i.e. the catalytic activity is lost). This process is well-known under the name ""sintering"" and it becomes tangible as the metal is close to its Tammann temperature. This temperature is often defined as the half of the metal's melting point on the absolute temperature scale. In fact, metals such as gold, silver and copper have a Tammann temperature that is well below the average temperature of exhaust-gas ($600-700^0\mathrm{C}$).
Tammann Temperature is $750^0\mathrm{C}$ for platinum, and $640^0\mathrm{C}$ for palladium. While it is only $405^0\mathrm{C}$ for copper, $345^0\mathrm{C}$ for silver and $395^0\mathrm{C}$ for gold.

To sum up, the candidate transition element for use as a catalyst in a catalytic converter: 
1) has a low affinity to poisons  such as sulfur compounds;
2) can be efficiently recycled;
3)  has a relatively high melting point."
Comparing acidities of substituted and aromatic carboxylic acids,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/7591/comparing-acidities-of-substituted-and-aromatic-carboxylic-acids,10k,"In the case of 3-chloropropanoic acid vs. formic acid, I suspect the disparity in expected acidity can mostly be explained by solvation effects. The 3-chloropropanoic acid is much bulkier than formic acid, and hence interacts with solvent molecules differently than formic acid does. There are two essential components to the thermodynamics of solvation:

Due to steric hindrance, it may be the case that the negative charge is less accessible to solvent molecules, and thus more weakly stabilized. I suspect the difference in enthalpy here is actually negligible, but I'm not able to find a reference at this time.
Perhaps more importantly, there is an entropic effect, in that larger molecules tend to require a larger number of solvent molecules to solvate them. These solvent molecules form highly ordered, cage-like structures, which is entropically unfavorable. I believe similar underlying mechanisms are at work in, e.g., the hydrophobic effect, micellization, protein folding, etc.

As Klaus Warzecha points out, if the chlorine were not as far-removed from the carboxylate moiety (since induction rapidly diminishes with growing distance), the strength of the inductive effect would trump the solvent effects.
In the case of benzoic acid, there are probably similar solvent effects occurring. Additionally, the benzene ring is actually electron-donating within the $\pi$-electron system of the molecule, which can only be destabilizing to the carboxylate conjugate base. Unlike in, e.g., phenol or aniline, the excess negative charge cannot actually be delocalized into the ring. Experimentally, the electron-donating effect of the ring (equivalently, the electron-withdrawing effect of the carboxylate) is confirmed by the fact that benzoic acid is severely deactivated in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions by comparison to ordinary benzene. The benzene ring's electron-withdrawing effect within the $\sigma$-framework (rationalized, according to valence bond theory, by the greater s-character of $\mathrm{sp^2}$ carbons) of the molecule is probably quite weak. There may also be Coulombic destabilization between the strong $\delta^+$ of the carboxylate carbon atom and the $\mathrm{sp^2}$ carbons of the aromatic ring, again due to greater s-character, although that's speculative."
What should be the oxidation state of oxygen in HOF (hypofluorous acid)?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15579/what-should-be-the-oxidation-state-of-oxygen-in-hof-hypofluorous-acid,29k,"Until the (recent) redefinition of the IUPAC, the concept of oxidation states was not as well defined as one would expect. I have discussed the issues of the old version and outlined the new definition in more detail in an answer to Electronegativity Considerations in Assigning Oxidation States.
When you apply the official pre-2016 definition (via the Internet Archive) from the IUPAC gold book, then you have to assign $\text{OS}(\ce{H}) = +1$ as it is not a compound with a metal, $\text{OS}(\ce{O}) = -2$ as it is no peroxide compound, and leaving the disturbing $\text{OS}(\ce{F})= \color\red{+1}$.
Going with the on electronegativity based alternative description, you will still assign $\text{OS}(\ce{H}) = +1$ as it has the lowest electronegativity. Then you assign $\text{OS}(\ce{F})= -1$, because of the highest electronegativity. This leaves a oxidation state of $\text{OS}(\ce{O}) = 0$.
This assignment is matched by the 2016 definition, the summary version of which is: The oxidation state of an atom is the charge of this atom after ionic approximation of its heteronuclear bonds. The definition refers to the use of Allen electronegativities (see Pure Appl. Chem. 2016, 88 (8), 831–839 for more detail). Consequently the heteronuclear approximation yields:

Why does mercury have low melting and boiling points?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/13667/why-does-mercury-have-low-melting-and-boiling-points,30k,"Mercury is different!  It is not as reactive as its neighbors in the Periodic Table, it doesn't conduct heat and electricity as well as other metals, and it is a liquid unlike other metals.  The electronic structure of mercury is $\ce{[Xe] 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^2}$, so the first thing we notice is that all of its orbitals are full, there are no unpaired electrons in mercury.  This helps explain mercury's reluctance to react with other materials or form bonds with other mercury atoms.  Most metal atoms share their outer electrons with other metal atoms, in fact, all of these ""shared"" metal electrons exist as a diffuse ""sea"" of electrons.  It is the extended nature of this sharing that makes metals good conductors of heat and electricity.  The fact that the metal electrons are shared provides a strong bonding interaction between metal atoms that gives metals their solid structure.  None of this applies to mercury.  With its filled shell electron configuration it is very reluctant to form bonds even with other mercury atoms. 
One additional, interesting effect makes mercury even more reluctant to share its electrons.  Special relativity suggests that for larger nuclei (and mercury with atomic number 80 is large enough for the effect to apply) electrons will begin to travel closer to the speed of light.  In turn, their mass will increase and as mass increases, orbital radius decreases.  The electron is closer to the nucleus, more attracted to the nucleus and less available for bonding.  Here is a nice reference that explains this relativistic effect and how it applies to mercury in plain English and a bit more detail.
These two effects, filled outer electron shell and contraction of the outer orbital closer to the nucleus, combine to make mercury reluctant to form bonds, even with other mercury atoms.  It is this lack of electron bonding between mercury atoms that makes it melt and boil at such low temperatures."
Why are vinylic and arylic carbocations highly unstable?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10509/why-are-vinylic-and-arylic-carbocations-highly-unstable,26k,"Background
S-orbitals are lower in energy than p-orbitals, therefore the more s-character in an orbital, the lower its energy and the more stable any electrons occupying the orbital.  In other words, electrons will be more stable (lower in energy) in an $\ce{sp}$ orbital than an $\ce{sp^2}$ orbital, and electrons in an $\ce{sp^2}$ orbital will be lower in energy than those in an $\ce{sp^3}$ orbital.
This is the basis of the inductive effect.  For example, it explains why the electrons in an $\ce{sp^3}$ methyl group will be drawn towards a connected $\ce{sp^2}$ carbon in an aromatic ring - the methyl group is inductively electron donating to the aromatic ring as its $\ce{sp^3}$ electrons drift towards the lower energy $\ce{sp^2}$ aromatic carbon.
What we're really saying is that an $\ce{sp}$ hybridized carbon atom is more electronegative (it's lower in energy and the electrons prefer to move towards it) than an $\ce{sp^2}$ hybridized carbon atom, which in turn is more electronegative than an $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized carbon atom.
Answer
Look at the figure below, notice that in the alkyl carbocation on the left the cationic center is attached to an $\ce{sp^3}$ carbon, whereas in the vinylic cation in the middle, the cationic center is attached to a more electronegative $\ce{sp^2}$ carbon.  For a positive center to be attached to a more electronegative group is destabilizing.  Hence the vinylic cation is less stable than a typical alkyl cation.
Things are even worse with the aryl carbocation on the right.  Here the positive carbon is attached to 2 $\ce{sp^2}$ carbons. Destabilizing the aryl cation even further is its geometry.  A vinyl cation prefers to be linear, but due to geometrical constraints imposed by the aromatic ring the aryl cation must be bent and the empty orbital is forced to be $\ce{sp^2}$ rather than $\ce{p}$.  These three factors combine to make the aryl carbocation even higher in energy than the vinyl cation."
Why are some salt solutions coloured?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/2547/why-are-some-salt-solutions-coloured,36k,"You're right--it's got to do with them being transition metals (usually). Transition metal ions form coordination complexes. Their empty $d$ orbitals accept lone pairs from other molecules (called ""ligands"") and form larger molecules (though we don't call them that--we call them ""complexes""). When put in water, the ligand is $\ce{H2O}$, and you get complexes like $\ce{Cu[(H2O)6]^{2+}}$ (this is what you get when you add water to Copper Sulphate). Thus, metals with no empty $d$ orbitals of comparable energy become colourless.
OK, but where do coordination compounds get their color from? Well, $d$ orbitals look like this: 

Even though the last one looks different, these are all identical in many respects, the most important being that they have the same energy. So if an electron jumps from one orbital to another, it on't make any difference. In fact, since this is a quantum mechanical system, it (sort of) doesn't even make sense to talk about electrons jumping from here to there.
All this changes when you have some ligands around. In coordination complexes, the $d$ orbitals are hybridised with the $s$ and $p$ orbitals of the next or previous shell. If we're talking about octahedral complexes, all the orbital lobes have to be aligned along the coordinate axes (since the $p$ orbitals are). This can be said to come from the fact that we're ""mixing"" these orbitals to get orthogonal hybrid orbitals, but that may not be that good an analogy. Now, the ligands approach along the coordinate axes since their final position will be in hybrid orbitals along the axes. So, they approach the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals (as well as the $s$ and $p$ orbitals). The repulsion generated makes these orbitals of higher energy than the other three $d$ orbitals. This is called ""d-orbital splitting"" {*}

Now, electrons may ""jump"" between the $d$ orbitals (the energy gap isn't so high that the jump is too improbable). Due to the energy gap, some energy is absorbed/released in the form of a photon and it just happens to fall within the visible spectrum (at least, for most transition metals, it does). This jump is called a $d-d$ transition.
Using this, we can easily show why $\ce{Zn}$ salts are colourless. In $\ce{Zn}$, the $3d$ orbitals are full, so they're useless from the ligand point of view. The $4d$ orbitals are, on the other hand, empty. Ideal for forming a coordination complex with the $4s$ and $4p$, but there won't be any $d-d$ transitions as there are no electrons in $4d$ to jump around. (Remember, this is before the ligand bonds)
*For tetrahedral complexes, the $d$ orbitals take no active part in the bonding, and the ligands approach between the axes. This leads to an opposite gap between the top three(known as $t_{2g}$) and bottom two($e_g$) orbitals, with the $t_{2g}$ orbitals at a higher energy. So we still get $d-d$ transitions and color, though IIRC many tetrahedral compounds do not have a visible color(the energy gap is about half that of the corresponding ocahedral gap--and may not give a photon with a visible frequency)"
What is the smell of 'burning' metal?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/8370/what-is-the-smell-of-burning-metal,26k,"According to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety page Welding - Fumes And Gases, the welding fumes are

This composition varies dependent on the composition of metals being welded and fluxes.  The website lists several main types and their associated health risks.  Often associated with metallic oxides are some pungent/noticeable gases:

Why does hydrogen fluoride have a boiling point so much lower than that of water?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/35349/why-does-hydrogen-fluoride-have-a-boiling-point-so-much-lower-than-that-of-water,67k,"I think there are a variety of qualitative ways of looking at this:

Perhaps the most obvious is that $\ce{H2O}$ can form a greater number of hydrogen bonds due to having an equal numbers of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors. Each of the hydrogen atoms can be hydrogen bond acceptors; each of the lone pairs on the oxygen can be donors. In $\ce{HF}$ however there is only one hydrogen bond acceptor and theoretically three hydrogen bond donors. This imbalanced ratio inevitably leaves some acceptors without a donor. Imagine this as two dance parties; one party has two men and two women but the other has one man and three women. Obviously fewer bonds can be successfully formed in the latter, assuming that everything is monogamous. 
As mentioned by the other poster, both O and F are very electronegative elements. F however is more EN than O, which means that F stabilizes electrons better than O. As a result, electrons localized on F are weaker hydrogen bond donors; they are already fairly well stabilized. Remember, electrons ""want"" to be stabilized by nuclei. If they already are fairly well stabilized then they will ""feel"" less of a need to be associated (and therefore stabilized) with (by) other nuclei. This suggests that the hydrogen bonding present among $\ce{HF}$ molecules might be weaker than the hydrogen bonds present among $\ce{H2O}$ molecules. 

Experimental results are the gold standard, of course, as opposed to qualitative reasoning, and qualitative reasoning here can also lead us in the opposite direction; one might argue that by having three lone pairs, F has a lot on its plate, so to speak; it might be able to stabilize one lone pair of electrons very well but three lone pairs is a bigger ordeal, and perhaps big enough that the hydrogen bonds among $\ce{HF}$ molecules are stronger than those among water molecules. Again, this is all qualitative, but this is the sort of reasoning introductory chemistry teachers desire. 
If we limit our thinking to just electrostatics then we might surmise that $\ce{HF}$ should have the stronger hydrogen bonds because F is more electron withdrawing and therefore hydrogen should be more positively polarized in $\ce{HF}$ as opposed to hydrogen in water. However, hydrogen bonding is more than just electrostatics. Hydrogen bonding actually has a covalent component; this, however is usually ignored by introductory treatments of chemistry. The bond angle of elements involved in a hydrogen bond is critical. The closer the elements involved in a hydrogen bond are to 180 degrees, the stronger the bond (this specific angle is the case with hydrogen bonding in water; not necessarily other molecules). If hydrogen bonding were purely electrostatic then this would not be the case; angles would not matter - only distance would. 
Other issues must be explored as well, such as the number of viable hydrogen bonds and the electron-donating/releasing tendencies of the involved elements.
After scouring the web some common ""explanations"" that would not explain why water has a higher boiling point than $\ce{HF}$ would be: 


water can form 4 per molecule while HF can only form 2.


Incorrect because if we only look at hydrogen bonding as involving the polarity of atoms, then how can water form four hydrogen bonds per molecule? It has two positively charged hydrogens, and a negatively charged oxygen. Seems like it should only form three hydrogen bonds. One must understand that lone pairs can each be hydrogen bond donors."
How does oil on the surface of water prevent rust?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34717/how-does-oil-on-the-surface-of-water-prevent-rust,30k,"Well, I went and searched for the solubility of oxygen in water and oil, and found this summary paper on the NIST web site: ""The Solubility of Oxygen and Ozone in Liquids"" by Battino, Rettich and Tominaga, J. Phys. Chem.Ref. Data., vol 12, no. 2, 1983.
Conveniently, the paper gives solubility data for oxygen in both water and olive oil.  The solubility is given both as molar fractions, and also as the Ostwald coefficient $L$, defined as the volume of gas absorbed per volume of absorbing liquid.
Given the very different molar volumes of water and olive oil, I believe the latter provides a much more useful comparison here.  Comparing tables 1 (water; note the $10^2$ factor in the header) and 25 (olive oil) in the paper, we see that the Ostwald solubility coefficient for oxygen in water is about 2,000 times higher than in olive oil:
 Temp. (K) | Temp. (°C) | L (water) | L (olive oil)
-----------+------------+-----------+---------------
    298.15 |         25 |     310.4 |        0.1269
    308.15 |         35 |     276.6 |        0.1326
    318.15 |         45 |     254.5 |        0.1383
    328.15 |         55 |     240.9 |        0.1441

So, yes, oxygen is a lot more soluble in water than in oil.  But why?
Well, if this web site is to be believed, it's because of the strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules, which causes even liquid water to maintain some degree of an ice-like lattice structure, with gaps that small gas molecules like $\ce{O2}$ can easily slip into.  Once there, the gas becomes solvated, with the strongly polar water molecules inducing a temporary dipole in the $\ce{O2}$ molecule and thus creating an attractive Debye interaction.  The overall solvation process is exothermic (i.e. releases heat), explaining why the solubility of oxygen in water decreases with temperature."
What is the role of sulfuric acid and mercury(II) sulfate in the oxymercuration of alkynes?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/40612/what-is-the-role-of-sulfuric-acid-and-mercuryii-sulfate-in-the-oxymercuration,57k,"Let's first look at the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne. Just like in the analogous reaction of alkenes, the new proton goes to the least substituted position, to give the most substituted carbocation. Water attacks the carbocation, and after deprotonation, an enol is produced. Under acidic conditions, the enol tautomerizes the the corresponding ketone.

The mechanism with mercury catalysis is very similar. The main difference is that the initial intermediate is a mercurinium ion, which is opened by the nucleophilic attack of water at the more substituted site. Beyond that, you can think of the mercury atom as a giant proton. The mechanism proceeds analogously, first through a mercury substituted enol, which is protonated and then demercurated.

So why is mercury typically used? We know from oxymercuration, that using mercury avoids carbocations that are prone to rearrangement. The sp2 (vinyl) carbocation shown in the first mechanism is less stable than sp3 carbocations, so we would expect rearrangement to be an issue. Avoiding the high energy carbocation also increases the rate of reaction."
Why are the majority of cleaning solutions basic?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/347/why-are-the-majority-of-cleaning-solutions-basic,30k,"Basic dishwashing agents? 

Some dishwashing agents contain substantial amounts of NaOH, see below. 
Sometimes NaClO solutions are used as disinfectant for dishwashing.

 Dishwashing liquid chemistry? 
If we approximate the food rests you want to clean away during the dishwashing as mixture of carbohydrate, proteins and lipids, then your dishwashing liquid needs that take care of those 3 substance classes in water.

carbohydrates are hydrophilic - no problem here.
amphiphils are needed to clean lipophilic substances like lipids, oils, greases as Ashu explained already. They can take care of quite a bit of protein as well.
basic solutions usually cause a faster hydrolysis of the amide bonds in proteins than acids. Usually quite a bit faster: NaOH-solutions immediately give a ""soapy"" feeling while e.g. HCl doesn't. 
As far as I know here (Germany), basic liquids for household dishwashing machines are uncommon/seldom/not used at all (I'm not so sure about the tablets). The actually used solutions are less corrosive (for both the machine and your fingers if you more or less accidentally decide to use it for dishwashing by hand).
This page from a New Zealand poison centre talks about the ""dishwasher [...] powder or tablets [...] are often highly alkaline""
For dishwashing liquids where you are thought/supposed to put your hands in, the pH is usually neutral to slightly acidic, so you need to scrub a bit more, but don't dissolve your skin.

 Acids for cleaning? 
Acids (usually acetic acid or citric acid, maybe HCl) are used in ""household chemistry"" to clean limescale (CaCO$_3$). But that usually isn't the problem of your dirty dishes. 
Dishwashing machines use ion exchangers to soften the water (or phosphate in the dishwashing agent), so you don't get limescale or lime soaps inside the machine."
Why does sunlight cause colors to fade?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/29445/why-does-sunlight-cause-colors-to-fade,27k,"Dyes and pigments work by absorbing certain wavelengths of light and reflecting or transmitting the rest. When a dye molecule absorbs a photon, an electron is excited to a higher energy state. Most of the time (neglecting fluorescence), the molecule de-excites by giving off heat and returns to the ground state intact. However, because the excited state is a high energy state, it has the potential to undergo a chemical reaction, breaking a covalent bond or otherwise irreversibly reacting with another molecule. This changes the electronic structure of the molecule which changes its absorption properties: e.g. many dyes that absorb visible light have large systems of conjugated double bonds and if these are broken, the absorbance can shift to much shorter wavelengths. How likely this kind of destructive chemistry is depends on the nature of the dye. Organic dyes tend to be more susceptible to photobleaching than things like quantum dots and inorganic pigments.
Touching on Nicolau's comment, red paint can often degrade faster because it absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. The more energy that is available, the more likely it is that reactions will occur. This is more pronounced as we enter UV wavelengths, which is why UV-B can cause thymine dimers in DNA, which can lead to skin cancer. For outdoor signs and such, UV-blocking coatings are often applied to extend the life of the dyes.
It's also not necessary for the light to interact directly with the dye molecules to cause bleaching: depending on what other molecules are present with the dye (solvents, etc), these other molecules may produce reactive species that then react with the dye."

From there the electron from Hydrogen forms a lone pair with the oxygen of the same molecule forming $\ce{OH^-}$.

Why is dU an exact differential and dq an inexact differential?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/22171/why-is-du-an-exact-differential-and-dq-an-inexact-differential,26k,"As opposed to an exact differential, an inexact differential cannot be expressed as the differential of a function, i.e. while there exist a function $U$ such that $U = \int \mathrm{d} U$, there is no such functions for $\text{đ} q$ and $\text{đ} w$.
And the same is, of course, true for any state function $a$ and any path function $b$ respectively: an infinitesimal change in a state function is represented by an exact differential $\mathrm{d} a$ and there is a function $a$ such that $a = \int \mathrm{d} a$, while an infinitesimal change in a path function $b$ is represented by an inexact differential $\text{đ} b$ and there is no function $b$ such that $b = \int \text{đ} b$.
Consequently, for a process in which a system goes from state $1$ to state $2$ a change in a state function $a$ can be evaluated simply as
$$\int_{1}^{2} \mathrm{d} a = a_{2} - a_{1} \, ,$$ 
while a change in a path function $b$ can not be evaluated in such a simple way,
$$\int_{1}^{2} \text{đ} b \neq b_{2} - b_{1} \, .$$
And for a state function $a$ in a thermodynamic cycle
$$\oint \mathrm{d} a = 0 \, ,$$
while for a path function $b$
$$\oint \text{đ} b \neq 0 \, .$$
The last mathematical relations are important, for instance, for the first law of thermodynamics, because while $\oint \text{đ} q \neq 0$ and $\oint \text{đ} w \neq 0$ it was experimentally found that $\oint (\text{đ} q + \text{đ} w) = 0$ for a closed system, which implies that there exist a state function $U$ such that $\mathrm{d} U = \text{đ} q + \text{đ} w$."
The acidity of boric acid,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/14165/the-acidity-of-boric-acid,13k,"I think your suppositions and observations are basically correct. On the basis of general principles, it is certainly possible to imagine that such a mechanism might be at play. If one considers the structure of boric acid, it should be readily apparent that the boron atom could be quite electrophilic and hence act as a Lewis acid: it possesses a formally vacant $p$-orbital; it is bound to highly electronegative oxygen atoms, which withdraw electron density and create a partial positive $(\delta^+)$ charge on it (though this effect may be mitigated by the oxygen lone pairs, which can donate electron density into the aforementioned $p$-orbital); and finally, it has a planar geometry that makes it quite sterically accessible to approaching nucleophiles. Such a mechanism is also lent plausibility by the well-known propensity of various other boron compounds for forming Lewis adducts and being highly susceptible to hydrolysis (where applicable).
All of that having been said, I don't think it's fair to claim that such a mechanism is ""obviously"" correct for the reasons given above. Such arguments are strictly qualitative, and while they're very suggestive of the possibility, they are in no sense definitive. The only way to even approach something vaguely approximating certainty is to perform experiments (perhaps in concert with theoretical computations), and even there considerable difficulty exists in reaching firm conclusions. The confirmed presence of $\ce{B(OH)4-}$ under one particular set of conditions is not sufficient proof that the mechanism involving boron as a Lewis acid is always operative, nor does it rule out other pathways. (Note that I'm not necessarily disputing that mechanism, but only pointing out that extrapolating too widely from specific experimental results has certain liabilities.) As ron points out in his answer, the issue apparently isn't settled.
Edit: I would also add that there are arguments to be made against such a mechanism. There's likely some degree of $\pi$-bonding between the oxygen lone pairs and the boron, which would be disrupted by the pyramidalization of the molecule upon formation of the intermediate Lewis adduct resulting from nucleophilic attack by $\ce{H2O}$. The associated energy penalty might be relevant to the reaction kinetics under some conditions. My instinct is that this is probably not significant, but it may be a factor worth considering. Of course, this is all speculative on my part, though I think it further demonstrates that qualitative reasoning in chemistry is rarely clear-cut, and there's an awful risk of falling prey to fuzzy thinking. Hence, rigorous experimentation and calculation are vital."
How does adding lemon juice to sugar make better caramel?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/555/how-does-adding-lemon-juice-to-sugar-make-better-caramel,47k,"The citric acid in lemon juice hydrolyzes the sucrose molecules into glucose and fructose as you heat the sugar. The water in the lemon juice is also part of this process. This mixture of monosaccharides is much less crystalline in the same way that most mixtures are less crystalline than pure substances. Wikipedia has a good article on this process under the title ""Inverted sugar syrup"". The syrup is ""inverted"" in the sense that the sign of its optical rotation has changed because sucrose has a large positive optical rotation while fructose has a large negative optical rotation. Glucose has a positive optical rotation, but of a lower magnitude than sucrose.
The reaction is:
$$\ce{\underset{(sucrose)}{C12H22O11} + H2O -> \underset{(glucose)}{C6H12O6} + \underset{(fructose)}{C6H12O6}}$$
The reaction can occur to a small degree by simply heating sugar with water in absence of acid catalysis. I assume the acid is necessary to get good conversion before you burn your sugar or vaporize all of the water.
Honey is a naturally occurring inverted sugar syrup of this type. Honey is resistant to crystallization because it is a mixture of glucose and fructose. Honey is also slightly acidic."
How can the intense color of potassium permanganate be explained with molecular orbital theory?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/39829/how-can-the-intense-color-of-potassium-permanganate-be-explained-with-molecular,11k,"Let’s take a look at a qualitative MO scheme for a tetrahedric transition metal complex whose ligands have three p-type orbitals each.

Only orbitals of the same symmetry will mix, so the $\mathrm{t_1}$ ones stay where they are originally. I have colour-coded both the $\mathrm{t_2}$ (red) and $\mathrm{e}$ (blue) orbitals.

Figure 1: Qualitative MO scheme of a tetrahedric complex with σ and π bonding between metal and ligands. Double vertical lines represent electron pairs.
Note that the image is qualitative only. The order of energy levels can be different; it is not possible to predict it a priori. The more electronegative a side is, the lower its orbital energies will be. Manganese(VII) is lacking seven electrons so the orbital energies will be very low, will oxygen profits from its high electronegativity. All in all, the energies will be somewhat similar.
We can consider the filled orbitals to be mostly ligand-centred and the empty ones to be mostly metal-centred, in full alignment with the picture of a $\ce{d^0}$ $\ce{Mn^{VII}}$ core and four $\ce{O^2-}$ ligands with electron octets.
The electronic transition that causes the intense purple colour corresponds to an excitation from $\mathrm{t_1}$ to $\mathrm{e}$ — $\mathrm{t_1}$ should always be the highest ligand orbital, while tetrahedric symmetry typically implies that $\mathrm{e}$ lies lower than $\mathrm{t_2}$ on the metal’s side. The higher the central metal’s oxidation state, the lower its orbitals and the closer it is to the ligands’ p-orbitals.
Since the transition is from a ligand-centred to a metal-centred orbital, it is called Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT). Oversimplified, one could think of it as a one-electron reduction of manganese by an oxygen ligand to intermediately create $\ce{Mn^{VI}-O^{.}}$.
The transition is obviously spin-allowed (filled to empty orbitals) and the Laporte-rule is invalid in tetrahedric complexes as there is no centre of symmetry. Therefore, the observed colour is very intense."

Benzoin will not give a positive test, since it cannot tautomerize to an aldehyde. What does benzoin form upon tautomerization?"
Stability of carbocations: CF3+ vs CH3+,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/40076/stability-of-carbocations-cf3-vs-ch3,15k,$\ce{CF3+}$ is more stable than $\ce{CH3+}$. The comparison between -I and +R effect is made while talking about activation or deactivation of halogens when substituted on benzene. Fluorine always stabilises a carbocation to a large extent because of a very good overlap of $\ce{2p -~2p}$ orbitals.
Why is there a difference in the colours of K₂Cr₂O₇ and K₂CrO₄?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/28682/why-is-there-a-difference-in-the-colours-of-k%e2%82%82cr%e2%82%82o%e2%82%87-and-k%e2%82%82cro%e2%82%84,12k,"I'm really excited for this because I get to reference the almighty color wheel!! Fair warning, this answer is much more qualitative than quantitative, but that's more interesting sometimes anyways.
If you look at the structure of the chromate and dichromate ions next to each other (see here for structures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromate_and_dichromate), the only major difference between the two is that the Cr-O bond joining the two chromate ions (missing an oxygen) is now a single bond. This means that bond will vibrate at a lower frequency, and because frequency and wavelength are inversely related, that bond will absorb a longer wavelength of light.
Now to the color wheel! It is a general chemistry (often unexplained) fact that the color we see is the complementary color of the wavelength of a bond's vibration. Thus, in the case of the chromate ion, we see yellow, and across from yellow is the purple-ish region. That means, if one of the bonds in the chromate ion, and thus two of the bonds in the dichromate ion, were absorbing a longer wavelength like we said earlier, on average we would expect something just longer than purple-ish, like blue, to be absorbed.
The complementary color of blue is red slash orange, and that is in fact the color we see in the dichromate ion!
At the heart of all this is the principle that the colors we see are those wavelengths of light which on average are not absorbed by a large number (on the order of Avogadro's number) of molecules.
An approach like this will only be reliable for very similar molecules like the two we have here."
Functional difference of Benedict's solution and Fehling's solution,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/62034/functional-difference-of-benedicts-solution-and-fehlings-solution,26k,"Fehling's solution consists of two parts, Fehling's A and Fehling's B. Fehling's A consists of aqueous copper(II) sulfate, while Fehling's B consists of aqueous sodium potassium tartrate ($\ce{NaK(C4H4O6)}$). Benedict's reagent consists of sodium carbonate, sodium citrate ($\ce{Na2(C6H6O7)}$), and copper(II) sulfate dissolved in water. It's pretty clear now, that the main difference between the two reagents is the complexing agent (citrate in Benedict's and tartrate in Fehling's).
Fehling's reagent was invented by Hermann von Fehling in 1849. You notice that this solution is given as two separate solutions and is only mixed together while performing a test. This is because the complex formed when mixed ($\ce{[Cu(C4O6)2]}$) is kinetically favored, and that $\ce{Cu(OH)2}$ will eventually precipitate out due to being favored thermodynamically. That's why the two solutions are stored, and only mixed during testing.

On the other hand, Benedict's reagent was discovered by Stanley Rossiter Benedict somewhere in between 1904 to 1936. Thus Benedict's reagent was developed after Fehling's was. The citrate complex in Benedict's reagent is much more stable that $\ce{Cu(OH)2}$, so Benedict's reagent doesn't precipitate on standing for long, unlike Fehling's. This is quite advantageous since you wouldn't have to mix two solutions together to perform the test. This is where Benedict's reagent is quite handy.

Both the reagents have a similar way of oxidizing aldehydes. The copper complex oxidized the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, and while reducing itself from $\ce{Cu^2+}$ to $\ce{Cu+}$
($E^\circ = \pu{0.154 V}$). This reduction potential is sufficient to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic acids. There is not much difference here though.
Neither of the reagents can oxidize aromatic aldehydes, due to the fact that they lack α-hydrogens, and thus oxidizing them requires stronger oxidizers (like Tollens’ reagent).
In short, Benedict's reagent is kind of like an ""improved"" version of Fehling's reagent, which is much more stable due to the difference in the complexing agent."

Which has stronger hydrogen bonds: water or ice?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/96452/which-has-stronger-hydrogen-bonds-water-or-ice,22k,"The quick answer is that ice has stronger hydrogen bonds than liquid water on average.$\require{mediawiki-texvc}%for angstrom unit$
As has already been brought up, this question is not easy to answer comprehensively as it may very well depend on temperature and pressure in ways that are not immediately obvious. That being said, I will answer this question for the most obvious case which is looking at hydrogen bond strength when water is just barely a liquid (just above $\pu{0~^\circ C}$) and when water is just barely frozen (just below $\pu{0~^\circ C}$). Also, as you may or may not know, ice freezes into many different forms which all have different lattice arrangements. I cannot speak to unusual forms of ice such as the one with a cubic lattice, but what I say is immediately applicable to forms like proton-ordered hexagonal ice (I think this is ice IX). Regular ice is called ice Ih.
It is worth looking at the very comprehensive reference [1], which discusses details of water from the dimer all the way to the many forms of ice that can form. The important points for us are only the following structural values, however:
In ice Ih, the average $\ce{O-H}$ bond length is $\pu{1.01 \AA}$ and the $\ce{HOH}$ bond angle is $109.5^\circ$. The trend that has been observed experimentally is that in going from the gas-phase water monomer, through the clusters, to the liquid, and finally to ice, the bond angle slowly increases to this tetrahedral value. Additionally, the average bond length in the liquid is shorter than in the solid, but you will have a hard time finding reliable reported values of this number from experiment because it is very difficult to determine the position of hydrogen atoms from scattering experiments in non-solid phases (this is mostly because of an ambiguity as to which oxygen atoms a hydrogen should be associated with in the scattering data). Nonetheless, there are reliable average $\ce{O-O}$ distances from scattering experiments.
In the liquid, the average $\ce{O-O}$ distance is $\pu{2.85 \AA}$ while in ice Ih it shrinks to $\pu{2.74 \AA}$. Intuitively, it is very hard to understand how this would happen if it is not simply due to increased hydrogen bond strength.
We can look at an even simpler case though and see that increased hydrogen bond strength causes the $\ce{O-O}$ distance to decrease in ice. This example is a comparison of the water dimer and water trimer. In the water dimer, the $\ce{O-O}$ distance is $\pu{2.976 \AA}$. In the water trimer, the $\ce{O-O}$ distance is about $\pu{2.82 \AA}$. This decrease in distance and the corresponding red shift in vibrational frequency are given physical meaning in the Ref. [2].
Ref. [2] gets at a very important point for us, one which Ref. [1] also uses to explain the shrinking in $\ce{O-O}$ distances in ice. This is because hydrogen bonding in water is highly cooperative. What do I mean by this? This is exactly the topic of Ref. [2]. The key idea is this: when you allow three water molecules to mutually hydrogen bond, as in the ring shape of the water trimer, the increase in attractive interaction strength is more than simply three times the interaction strength of a water dimer. By attractive interaction strength, I mean that if you subtract out the initial decrease in binding energy that comes from distorting the water monomers. Again, all of this is laid out in detail in Ref. [2], but we learn the general rule that many-body interactions in water are very important.
So, finally, I feel we have said enough to explain why the knowledge that a shrinking $\ce{O-O}$ distance and widening $\ce{HOH}$ angle tells us that ice has stronger hydrogen bonds than liquid water. In the first case, the decreasing $\ce{O-O}$ distance means that every pair of monomers experiences greater nuclear repulsion. This must be at least offset by a greater hydrogen bond strength in order for this geometry to be favorable. Part of the way this repulsion is offset is that as the system cools and forms a solid, the hydrogen bonds are allowed to become more ideal. This is why the bond angle widens. The tetrahedral arrangement of atoms means that the $\ce{OH--H}$ hydrogen-bond angle is much closer to 180 degrees on average than in the liquid where it frequently deviates fairly significantly.
There is one last point to make. It can be estimated both from accurate simulations and from experiment what is the average dipole moment of a water monomer in bulk liquid and in ice. It is found that the dipole increases going from the liquid to ice. This additionally tells us that the average charge on each hydrogen atom must have increased from in the liquid. We are guaranteed this because we know the bond angle increased, which should generally decrease the dipole moment (a linear configuration has no dipole). Instead, the bond angle increases, so we get more ideal hydrogen bonds, and the charge increases, so the hydrogen bonds would be stronger even if they were no more ideal than in the liquid!
Hopefully, this rather long-winded answer helps you understand how we can take the evidence at hand to arrive at the conclusion that ice has stronger hydrogen bonds than liquid water.

Now to the question of different forms of ice and different temperatures and pressures. I would think that pretty much across the board, every form of ice will follow the same trends we have seen here and hence have stronger hydrogen bonds. One strange case is cubic ice, which has $\ce{OHO}$ angles somewhere close to 90 degrees. This is very strange, but should lead to a large increase in the dipole of each molecule and probably an increase in positive charge on each hydrogen atom, so even then the hydrogen bonds should be stronger than in the liquid.
There may be temperatures and pressures where some of these arguments break down, but the $\ce{O-O}$ distance should smoothly decrease to that in the liquid and the angle should close to that in the liquid as the pressure increases, so one would expect the hydrogen bond strength to decrease to that in the liquid and never overshoot it.

Why do different substances have different boiling points?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/180/why-do-different-substances-have-different-boiling-points,89k,"The boiling point of a liquid depends on the intermolecular forces present between the atoms or molecules in the liquid since you must disrupt those forces to change from a liquid to a gas.

Two oxygen molecules are attracted to each other through London dispersion forces (induced temporary dipoles between the molecules) while water molecules are attracted to each other by hydrogen bonding (attraction of the + dipole on H in one molecule to the – dipole on an oxygen in an adjacent molecule) that is relatively strong. (Hydrogen bonding is an important intermolecular force for molecules where H is directly covalently bonded to F, O or N, which are quite electronegative and thus form bond with H with a relatively strong dipole.)

PBP vs TBP geometry?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/28692/pbp-vs-tbp-geometry,11k,"General Rule #1: Most elements use only s and p orbitals to form bonds, only transition elements and heavier elements use d, f, etc. orbitals in bonding.

In an earlier SE Chem post, the structure and bonding in the trigonal bipyramid molecule $\ce{PCl_5}$ was discussed.  The molecular hybridization is pictured below.  The axial bonds are hypercoordinate (this concept is explained in the earlier post) and they are constructed from p orbitals.  The equatorial bonds are constructed from $\ce{sp^2}$ orbitals.  General Rule #2 suggests that the equatorial bonds will be shorter than the axial bonds since the equatorial bonds contain more s-character.

As the following structural diagram shows, this is indeed the case.

Now let's turn our attention to the pentagonal bipyramid structure as found in $\ce{IF_7}$ for example.  Here is the structure for this molecule

As you noted in your question, the equatorial bonds are now longer than the axial bonds.  Based on what we've discussed thus far, we might make an initial ""guess"" that in $\ce{IF_7}$ the axial bonds have more s-character than the equatorial bonds.  As it turns out, this is correct.
Here is a link to an article discussing the structure and bonding in $\ce{IF_7}$.  Only the abstract is freely available.  For completeness, I'll mention that there was an earlier SE Chem question related to $\ce{IF_7}$, but it doesn't seem to add much to the conversation.  Returning to the published abstract, the key part of the abstract states,

""These features can be explained, however, by a bonding scheme
involving a planar, delocalized pxy hybrid on the central atom for the
formation of five equatorial, semi-ionic, 6-center 10-electron bonds
and an sp hybrid for the formation of two mainly covalent axial
bonds.""

The abstract tells us that the equatorial bonds are formed from the $\ce{p_{x}}$ and $\ce{p_{y}}$ orbitals; the axial bonds are formed from the $\ce{sp_{z}}$ hybrid orbitals (after using two p orbitals for equatorial bonding we are left with one $\ce{p_{z}}$ orbital and one s orbital on the central iodine, hence, when they combine two sp hybridized orbitals result).  That is the answer to the question.  As we guessed, there is more s-character in the axial bonds than the equatorial bonds.  Hence, the axial bonds are now shorter than the equatorial bonds.
For completeness
Someone, after reading that last paragraph, is going to notice that there are 5 equatorial fluorines, but only 4 bonding sites with the two p orbitals - what gives?  First off, note that the $\ce{p_{x}}$ and $\ce{p_{y}}$ orbitals on iodine form hypercoordinate bonds with the p orbital on fluorine and so yes, there are only 4 equatorial points of attachment.  But note that the abstract also mentioned that the equatorial bonds are semi-ionic.  This suggests that we have a resonance structure where we have an [$\ce{IF_{6}^{+}}$][$\ce{F^{-}}$] ionic contributor.  We can draw 4 more resonance structures just like this for the other 4 equatorial $\ce{I-F}$ bonds.  This means that mixed in with our hypercoordinate p-p bonds is some ionic character - this allows us to make 5 equivalent equatorial bonds.  Said differently, our 5 equatorial bonds are all identical resonance hybrids obtained by mixing 2 hypercoordinate p bonds (each one providing bonding for 2 fluorines) with 1 ionic bond (providing bonding for 1 fluorine)."
Why do alkanes have higher boiling point than their ether counterparts?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/92094/why-do-alkanes-have-higher-boiling-point-than-their-ether-counterparts,10k,"I second that the Van der Waals forces will dominate, because the dipole of the symmetrical ethers is perpendicular to the long axis of the molecule.  In this case the number of electrons over a large surface area is going to play a bigger role in holding the molecules together. 
Oxygen has the same number of electrons as -CH₂-, but  because oxygen is more electronegative, it’s holding those electrons more tightly, making it less polarisable, and reducing the magnitude of the induced dipoles. 
I suspect that ᵀ he effect is less apparent for dimethyl ether because the polar C-O bonds play a bigger role because the partial-positive charges on the carbons is not attentispread down the carbon chain, muting it, but remains a concentrated, bare, bright spot of charge, which can interact with the lone pairs on other ether oxygens. Additionally, there is less steric hindrance from the floppy alkyl groups. To prevent this kind of dipole-dipole attraction."
Why are allenes chiral?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6477/why-are-allenes-chiral,16k,"Asked and answered, but I think one thing that's missing is that allenes are not planar like alkenes or alkynes are. You can refer to this question for an explanation.

The dihedral angle between the two halogens is 90 degrees (ideally). Here's an animation hopefully providing a better view of the 3D structure:

This results in the two mirror images being non-superimposable upon each other, which means the molecule satisfies the criterion for chirality. If you rotate the right-hand molecule by $90^\circ$ such that the blue and white atoms at the top coincide, the green and white atoms will not match each other.

In general, any allene with the formula $\ce{R^1R^2C=C=CR^3R^4}$ will be chiral as long as $\ce{R^1}\neq\ce{R^2}$ and $\ce{R^3}\neq\ce{R^4}$. In this case we have $\ce{H} \neq \ce{Br}$ and $\ce{H} \neq \ce{Cl}$, so the compound in the question is chiral.
If $\ce{R^1} = \ce{R^2}$ or $\ce{R^3} = \ce{R^4}$, then the compound will possess a mirror plane and will therefore be achiral."

Derivation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/59822/derivation-of-the-heisenberg-uncertainty-principle,25k,"The proof I will use is taken from Griffiths, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 2nd ed., pp 110-111.
Defining ""uncertainty""
Let's assume that the normalised state $|\psi\rangle$ of a particle can be expanded as a linear combination of energy eigenstates $|n\rangle$, with $\hat{H}|n\rangle = E_n |n\rangle$.
$$| \psi \rangle = \sum_n c_n |n\rangle \tag{1}$$
The expectation value (the ""mean"") of a quantity, such as energy, is given by
$$\begin{align}
\langle E\rangle &= \langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle \tag{2}
\end{align}$$
and the variance of the energy can be defined analogously to that used in statistics, which for a continuous variable $x$ is simply the expectation value of $(x - \bar{x})^2$:
$$\sigma_E^2 = \left\langle (E - \langle E\rangle)^2 \right\rangle \tag{3}$$
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and the ""uncertainty"" refers to the standard deviation. It's more proper to use $\sigma$ as the symbol, instead of $\Delta$, and this is what you will see in most ""proper"" texts.
$$\sigma_E = \sqrt{\left\langle (E - \langle E\rangle)^2 \right\rangle} \tag{4}$$
However, it's much easier to stick to the variance in the proof. Let's generalise this now to any generic observable, $A$, which is necessarily represented by a hermitian operator, $\hat{A}$. The expectation value of $A$ is merely a number, so let's use the small letter $a$ to refer to it. With that, we have
$$\begin{align}
\sigma_A^2 &= \left\langle (A - a)^2 \right\rangle  \tag{5} \\
&= \left\langle \psi \middle| (\hat{A} - a)^2 \middle| \psi \right\rangle \tag{6} \\
&= \left\langle \psi \middle| (\hat{A} - a) \middle| (\hat{A} - a)\psi \right\rangle \tag{7} \\
&= \left\langle (\hat{A} - a)\psi \middle| (\hat{A} - a) \middle| \psi \right\rangle \tag{8} \\
&= \left\langle (\hat{A} - a)\psi \middle| (\hat{A} - a)\psi \right\rangle \tag{9}
\end{align}$$
where, in going from $(7)$ to $(8)$, I have invoked the hermiticity of $(\hat{A} - a)$ (since $\hat{A}$ is hermitian and $a$ is only a constant). Likewise, for a second observable $B$ with $\langle B \rangle = b$,
$$\sigma_B^2 = \left\langle (\hat{B} - b)\psi \middle| (\hat{B} - b)\psi \right\rangle \tag{10}$$
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
...states that, for all vectors $f$ and $g$ belonging to an inner product space (suffice it to say that functions in quantum mechanics satisfy this condition),
$$\langle f | f \rangle \langle g | g \rangle \geq |\langle f | g \rangle|^2 \tag{11}$$
In general, $\langle f | g \rangle$ is a complex number, which is why we need to take the modulus. By the definition of the inner product,
$$\langle f | g \rangle = \langle g | f \rangle^* \tag{12}$$
For a generic complex number $z = x + \mathrm{i}y$, we have
$$|z|^2 = x^2 + y^2 \geq y^2 \qquad \qquad \text{(since }x^2 \geq 0\text{)} \tag{13}$$
But $z^* = x - \mathrm{i}y$ means that
$$\begin{align}
y &= \frac{z - z^*}{2\mathrm{i}} \tag{14} \\
|z|^2 &\geq \left(\frac{z - z^*}{2\mathrm{i}}\right)^2 \tag{15}
\end{align}$$
and plugging $z = \langle f | g \rangle$ into equation $(15)$, we get
$$|\langle f | g \rangle|^2 \geq \left[\frac{1}{2\mathrm{i}}(\langle f | g \rangle - \langle g | f \rangle) \right]^2 \tag{16}$$
Now, if we let $| f \rangle = | (\hat{A} - a)\psi \rangle$ and $| g \rangle = | (\hat{B} - B)\psi \rangle$, we can combine equations $(9)$, $(10)$, $(11)$, and $(16)$ to get:
$$\begin{align}
\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 &= \langle f | f \rangle \langle g | g \rangle \tag{17} \\
&\geq |\langle f | g \rangle|^2 \tag{18} \\
&\geq \left[\frac{1}{2\mathrm{i}}(\langle f | g \rangle - \langle g | f \rangle) \right]^2 \tag{19}
\end{align}$$
Expanding the brackets
If you've made it this far - great job - take a breather before you continue, because there's more maths coming.
We have1
$$\begin{align}
\langle f | g \rangle &= \left\langle (\hat{A} - a)\psi \middle| (\hat{B} - b)\psi \right\rangle \tag{20} \\
&= \langle \hat{A}\psi |\hat{B}\psi \rangle - \langle a\psi |\hat{B}\psi \rangle - \langle \hat{A}\psi | b\psi \rangle + \langle a\psi |b\psi \rangle \tag{21} \\
&= \langle \psi |\hat{A}\hat{B}|\psi \rangle - a\langle \psi |\hat{B}\psi \rangle - b\langle \hat{A}\psi | \psi \rangle + ab\langle \psi |\psi \rangle \tag{22} \\
&= \langle \psi |\hat{A}\hat{B}|\psi \rangle - ab - ab + ab \tag{23} \\
&= \langle \psi |\hat{A}\hat{B}|\psi \rangle - ab \tag{24}
\end{align}$$
Likewise,
$$\langle g | f \rangle = \langle \psi |\hat{B}\hat{A}|\psi \rangle - ab \tag{25}$$
So, substituting $(24)$ and $(25)$ into $(19)$,
$$\begin{align}
\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 &\geq \left[\frac{1}{2\mathrm{i}}(\langle\psi |\hat{A}\hat{B}|\psi \rangle - \langle \psi |\hat{B}\hat{A}|\psi\rangle) \right]^2 \tag{26} \\
&= \left[\frac{1}{2\mathrm{i}}(\langle\psi |\hat{A}\hat{B} - \hat{B}\hat{A}|\psi \rangle ) \right]^2 \tag{27}
\end{align}$$
The commutator of two operators is defined as
$$[\hat{A},\hat{B}] = \hat{A}\hat{B} - \hat{B}\hat{A} \tag{28}$$
So, the term in parentheses in equation $(27)$ is simply the expectation value of the commutator, and we have reached the Robertson uncertainty relation:
$$\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 \geq \left(\frac{1}{2\mathrm{i}}\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B} ]\rangle \right)^2 \tag{29}$$
This inequality can be applied to any pair of observables $A$ and $B$.2 
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle
Simply substituting in $A = x$ and $B = p$ gives us
$$\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 \geq \left(\frac{1}{2\mathrm{i}}\langle[\hat{x},\hat{p} ]\rangle \right)^2 \tag{30}$$
The commutator of $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ is famously $\mathrm{i}\hbar$,3 and the expectation value of $\mathrm{i}\hbar$ is of course none other than $\mathrm{i}\hbar$. This completes the proof:
$$\begin{align}
\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 &\geq \left(\frac{1}{2\mathrm{i}}\cdot\mathrm{i}\hbar \right)^2 \tag{31} \\
&= \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 \tag{32} \\
\sigma_x \sigma_p &\geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \tag{33}
\end{align}$$
where we have simply ""removed the square"" on both sides because as standard deviations, $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_p$ are always positive.

Notes
1 I have skipped some stuff. Namely, $\langle \hat{A}\psi |\hat{B}\psi \rangle = \langle \psi |\hat{A}\hat{B}|\psi \rangle$ which is quite straightforward to prove using the hermiticity of both operators; $\langle \psi |\hat{A}|\psi \rangle = a$; $\langle \psi |\hat{B}|\psi \rangle = b$; and $a = a^*$ since it is the expectation value of a physical observable, which must be real.
2 This does not apply to, and cannot be used to derive, the energy-time uncertainty principle. There is no time operator in quantum mechanics, and time is not a measurable observable, it is only a parameter.
3 Technically, it is a postulate of quantum mechanics. (If I am not wrong, it derives from the Schrodinger equation, which is itself a postulate.)"

Red phosphorus is required for the regeneration of $\ce{HI}$ from $\ce{I2}$. $\ce{P_{red}}$ reacts with $\ce{I2}$ to the phosphorus iodides $\ce{PI3}$ and $\ce{PI5}$, which are subsequently hydrolyzed to $\ce{H3PO3}$/$\ce{H3PO4}$ and $\ce{HI}$, which is reused in further reduction steps. Catalytic amounts of $\ce{HI}$ are therefore sufficient to run the reaction in the presence of phosphorus. However, a too low concentration of $\ce{I-}$ will lead to elimination instead of substitution in the first reaction step.

(Image source)
The SET mechanism of the reduction is not described in detail in the article, so the following is a bit speculative. As a resonance-stabilized radical is involved, homolytic cleavage of the $\ce{C-I}$ bond is one of the first steps, which gives the benzylic radical $\ce{R.}$ and an iodine radical $\ce{I.}$. A single electron is transferred from $\ce{I-}$ to $\ce{R.}$, forming the carbanion $\ce{R-}$ and $\ce{I.}$, which recombines with another iodine radical to $\ce{I2}$. Protonation of $\ce{R-}$ yields the final product."
Can ozone have a triangular structure?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/22290/can-ozone-have-a-triangular-structure,17k,"Here is the Walsh diagram depicting all the valence molecular orbitals (a diagram showing how individual molecular orbitals change in energy due to bending around the central atom). Oxygen has 6 valence electrons, so ozone has 18 electrons in total. If we start on the right where ozone would be linear, we can see that all the orbitals up to the $2\pi_\mathrm u$ orbitals (don't worry about why they are named this) are doubly occupied and the two $2\pi_\mathrm u$ orbitals are both singly occupied.

Note: 6a$_1$ and 2b$_1$ have the incorrect sign on the outer p-orbitals.
If we bend the molecule slightly (moving to the left on the diagram), we can see that there is a favorable interaction between the p-type orbitals on the end as well as between the black of the central p-type orbital and the black of the outer p-type orbitals (Someone drew the $\mathrm{6a_1}$ and $\mathrm{2b_1}$ orbitals wrong, flip the central orbital). This lowers the energy of the molecule.
So why doesn't it keep bending? As a good first-order approximation, we can estimate the relative energy of configurations by the highest energy orbital (provided the other orbitals don't change too much). We can see that if we keep bending, the $\mathrm{1a_2}$ orbital and the $\mathrm{4b_2}$ orbital start rising in energy, eventually rising above the $\mathrm{6a_1}$ orbital. Thus too much bending will be unfavorable, and thus ozone prefers a bond angle of around $117^\circ$.
This same diagram can be used for other molecules, such as $\ce{CO2}$. Try using it to figure out why $\ce{CO2}$ is linear."
Dipole moments of pyrrole and furan,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/39315/dipole-moments-of-pyrrole-and-furan,16k,"Both pyrrole and furan have a lone pair of electrons in a p-orbital, this lone pair is extensively delocalized into the conjugated pi framework to create an aromatic 6 pi electron system.

in pyrrole there is an $\ce{N-H}$ bond lying in the plane of the ring and directed away from the ring
whereas in furan, there is a full lone pair of electrons in roughly the same position. 

The localized lone pair of electrons pointing away from the ring has a very significant effect on the dipole vector and is enough to cause the observed reversal in dipole moment direction between furan and pyrrole."
Why does brown sugar have a strong smell but white sugar doesn't?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/25184/why-does-brown-sugar-have-a-strong-smell-but-white-sugar-doesnt,13k,"Sugar is made by repeatedly boiling and cooling cane syrup (or sugar beet syrup).  After each cooling, the solution becomes supersaturated with respect to sucrose, causing sucrose to crystallize out of the ""mother liquor"" (the industrial term for the liquid solution from which crystals form). These crystals of ""raw"" sugar are heavily processed (washed in syrup, dissolved, treated with carbonate or phosphate minerals, recrystallized, and subject to ion exchange or charcoal color removal) to result in white sugar.
Nowadays, brown sugar is usually made by mixing refined white sugar with blackstrap molasses. In former times, the brown sugar was simply unrefined or unwashed crystal fraction from the 2nd or 3rd crystallization of cane juice. But precise control over the ratio of ""contaminating"" liquid to white crystalline sugar was difficult, which is why industry moved towards reconstituting brown sugar by mixing molasses and white sugar.
Blackstrap molasses is simply the spent ""mother liquor"" remaining after the third cycle of boiling and cooling to produce sugar crystals.
The smell of brown sugar thus comes primarily from molasses.  The smell of molasses is very complex.  Here is the abstract of a relevant paper:

The characteristic sweet-aroma components in refinery final molasses were isolated by using a combination of sensory evaluation, column chromatography and gas chromatography, and were identified by infrared spectrometry, mass spectrometry and color reactions. Identified were ethyl n-hexanoate, ethyl phenylacetate, phenylacetic acid, n-butyl benzoate, isopropyl benzoate, l(+)-pantolactone, benzoic acid, o-toluic acid, m-toluic acid, β-phenylpropionic acid, succinic anhydride, maltol, isomaltol, and 2-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-ethyl-γ-pyrone.
The aroma of the mixture of these compounds and vanillin and vanillic acid was similar to that of refinery molasses by sensory evaluation. The results indicate that these compounds are important in producing of sweet molasses aroma."

What makes ABS plastic turn yellow?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/74618/what-makes-abs-plastic-turn-yellow,22k,"What you're specifically describing is typically known as UV degradation.  The color change is due to the oxidation of the polymers that make up the plastic.  These chemical reactions are demonstrated in satisfying detail here.  Under the section titled ""Photodegradation"" is where you can find the intricacies of the polymer-oxidation process.  And yes, such damages are reversible.  As you will read, the oxidation process results in the formation of free radicals, which are ""atoms or groups of atoms with an odd (unpaired) number of electrons,"" to quote Wikipedia's definition.  The formation of these radicals is the reason for the color change (since certain light gets reflected because of these new molecules, in many cases yellow light, etc...)
To get rid of the radicals, you can add hydrogen peroxide, which allows hydrogen to bond with the radical (hydrogen has an additional electron), thus de-yellowing the plastic. This is demonstrated here.  
As a further note, UV degradation is not the only process that makes plastics turn yellow, as you will probably read in that paper.  There are also processes like biodegradation and mechanical degradation that are similar to photodegradation but still have their own cool processes.  
Your initial question was ""What makes ABS plastic turn yellow.""  I should point out that the first few words of the second link read ""Manufacturers add bromine to ABS plastic to act as flame retardant. Over time, those chemicals react to the plastic's basic polymers and turn yellow.""  Ergo, there is probably more to the yellowing of ABS plastic in particular than just photodegradation.  
Lastly, I should point out that the yellowing of plastic needn't happen in the presence of oxygen.  But again, that is addressed beautifully in the paper."
Why do SN2 reactions of alkyl halides proceed differently with KCN and AgCN?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/58104/why-do-sn2-reactions-of-alkyl-halides-proceed-differently-with-kcn-and-agcn,13k,"The cyanide anion is an example of an ambident nucleophile, these are nucleophiles which, usually due to delocalisation, are able to attack an electrophile from two or more atoms. In the case of the cyanide anion reaction from carbon leads to nitriles, whilst reaction from the nitrogen leads to isocyanides. 
To give the full IUPAC definition from the Gold Book:

A description applied to a chemical species whose molecular entities each possess two alternative and strongly interacting distinguishable reactive centres, to either of which a bond may be made in a reaction: the centres must be connected in such a way that reaction at either site stops or greatly retards subsequent attack at the second site. The term is most commonly applied to conjugated nucleophiles. [...]

To answer your actual question about why $\ce{KCN}$ forms nitriles, whilst $\ce{AgCN}$ forms isocyanides, March's Organic Chemistry (7th ed., p 449) gives a pretty concise answer in which we consider the extent to which the cyanide anion is associated with the counter-cation in solution. 

All negatively charged nucleophiles must of course have a positive counterion. If this ion is $\ce{Ag+}$ (or some other ion that specifically helps in removing the leaving group), rather than the more usual $\ce{Na+}$ or $\ce{K+}$, then the transition state is more $\mathrm{S_N1}$ like. Therefore the use of $\ce{Ag+}$ promotes attack at the more electronegative atom. For example, alkyl halides treated with $\ce{NaCN}$ generally give mostly $\ce{RCN}$, but the use of $\ce{AgCN}$ increases the yield of isocyanides ($\ce{RNC}$).

                           [See footnote]

This, of course, is not a complete picture, as solvent effects greatly change the reactivity. In protic solvents (MeOH, to give a possible example) the most electronegative atoms (nitrogen in this case) will be solvated to a greater extent via H-bondng. In aprotic solvents (THF/DMF, to give possible examples) the anion isn't solvated quite so much (on either atom of the nucleophile), but the cation is somewhat more solvated, leaving the nucleophile more able to attack (via the most electronegative atom as this is the most nucleophilic in the absence of other factors). 

Footnote: As an aside at this point, it's important to realise that these are not fully covalent bonds (in $\ce{AgCN}$ and $\ce{KCN}$), despite having some level of covalent character. We're somewhat bastardising the Winstein model of nucleophilic substitution in which we define $\mathrm{S_N1}$/$\mathrm{S_N2}$ based upon the separation between the cation and the anion at the point when substitution takes place, with the two mechanisms being extremes of a continuum:"
Why is the inversion barrier larger in PH3 than it is in NH3?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/38599/why-is-the-inversion-barrier-larger-in-ph3-than-it-is-in-nh3,11k,"Ammonia is the classic system for $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridisation save methane. The lone pair (and each of the $\unicode[Times]{x3C3}$-bonds) has almost $25~\%$ s-character which corresponds nicely to $\ce{sp^3}$. However, the whole system can also swing around, changing its hybridisation to $\ce{sp^2}$ and back; a process during which the lone pair is temporarily in a p-type orbital and the s-character of the bonding orbitals increases.
Elements outside of the second period show a much smaller tendency to involve the s-orbital in bonding. The bonding orbitals only have an s-character of approximately $16~\%$. This also means that the phosphorous lone pair has a much higher s-character of approximately $50~\%$, while the bonding $\unicode[Times]{x3C3}$-orbitals have a larger p-character. (This also explains the much smaller $\ce{H-P-H}$ bonding angle of approximately $90^\circ$.) An orbital of high s-character has a long way to go to turn into a p-type orbital, and the three largely p-type $\unicode[Times]{x3C3}$-orbitals have an equally long way to go to give $\ce{sp^2}$-type orbitals so the interconversion and thereby the inversion of $\ce{PH3}$ is strongly hindered."
How can the Bonding in IF7 be explained using LCAO method?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6785/how-can-the-bonding-in-if7-be-explained-using-lcao-method,11k,"No 6-centre-10-electron bond.
The bonding situation in $\ce{IF7}$ is explained by Christe et. al. (see ssavec's answer) as a 6-centre-10-electron bond. In the article itself I found no real evidence that supports this statement and I believe it to be completely wrong. The following section is taken from Karl O. Christe, E. C. Curtis, David A. Dixon, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115 (4), 1520–1526. and might as well be the culprit of this monstrosity.

The bonding in the square-planar $\ce{XeF4}$, can be described by two semi-ionic, 3-center 4-electron (3c-4e) bonds for the four $\ce{Xe-F}$ bonds and two lone valence electron pairs on $\ce{Xe}$ ($\mathrm{s^2p}_z^2$ hybrids). The 3c-4e bonds involve the $\mathrm{p}_x^2$ and $\mathrm{p}_y^2$ orbitals of xenon. Addition of an $\ce{F-}$ ion to the equatorial plane in $\ce{XeF4}$, results in pentagonal-planar $\ce{XeF5-}$ and the formation of a semi-ionic, 6-center 10-electron (6c-10e) bond involving the delocalized $\mathrm{p}_x^2\mathrm{p}_y^2$ hybrid orbitals of $\ce{Xe}$ and six electrons on the five $\ce{F}$ ligands. The two lone valence electron pairs on $\ce{Xe}$ in $\ce{XeF5-}$ are analogous to those in $\ce{XeF}$.
  The planar $\ce{IF5}$ fragment of $\ce{IF7}$, has essentially the same bonding as $\ce{XeF5-}$, as shown by the atomic population calculations given in Table VII. [...]

They continue to compare the populations of the valence orbitals in question, without stating the what methods they used to determine that.

The electronic structure calculations were done at the ab initio molecular orbital (MO) and local density functional (LDF) levels. [...]

A more accurate description of the bonding in in $\ce{IF7}$
Iodine heptafluoride is one of the classic examples when it comes to describing hypervalency and octet-expansion. Early attempts included d-Orbitals into describing that phenomenon (VSEPR), resulting in a description that yields the correct geometry. We now know that this theory is obsolete and more often wrong than correct.
A very principle problem in describing the bonding in this molecule is assuming that it is completely covalent bound. Christe et. al. acknowledge that this is wrong by stating ""semi-ionic"" bonds. This is - as we will see - already a stretch.
A more accurate terminology for these kind of molecules is hyper-coordinated; i.e. the central atom has a higher coordination number than common.
The following analysis utilises a calculation on the local density approximation level of theory. The used basis set is of triple zeta quality and employs a small effective core potential for iodine. The density fitting approximation was used to somewhat speed up the calculations. This is often denoted as DF-BP86/def2-TZVPP. The program used is Gaussian 09 rev. D.
Geometry
The performance of the method is not overwhelming. The bond lengths are overestimated by quite a bit. As cited by Christe, observed is $r_\mathrm{obs}(\ce{I-F_{ax}})=178.1~\mathrm{pm}$ and $r_\mathrm{obs}(\ce{I-F_{eq}})=185.7~\mathrm{pm}$. I calculated $r_\mathrm{BP86}(\ce{I-F_{ax}})=190.4~\mathrm{pm}$ and $r_\mathrm{BP86}(\ce{I-F_{eq}})=195.6~\mathrm{pm}$. Other methods, that I could still reasonably perform did not do much better. The MP2 result is $r_\mathrm{MP2}(\ce{I-F_{ax}})=186.6~\mathrm{pm}$ and $r_\mathrm{MP2}(\ce{I-F_{eq}})=191.9~\mathrm{pm}$.
For the purpose of the analysis the DFT method should be enough. (I had a look at the other results, too; they don't differ significantly.)
Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)
I would usually start with looking at the orbitals, but in this case it is more appropriate to look at the electron density itself. Better yet, we look at the Laplacian of the electron density. The depicted QTAIM plots are the Laplacian distribution within the molecule. Solid blue lines indicate charge depletion $\nabla^2\rho>0$, dashed red lines indicate charge accumulation $\nabla^2\rho<0$, red spheres are bond critical points, solid black lines are bond paths, dark red lines are zero flux surfaces (these separate the atoms). See an earlier answer of me for some more information on QTAIM.
We have two bond critical points to consider, one for the axial and one for the equatorial bond. We find low values of electron density at both; $\rho(\ce{I-F_{eq}})=0.125~\mathrm{a.\!u.}$; $\rho(\ce{I-F_{ax}})=0.137~\mathrm{a.\!u.}$. The Laplacian at both points is positive; $\nabla^2\rho(\ce{I-F_{eq}})=0.33~\mathrm{a.\!u.}$; $\nabla^2\rho(\ce{I-F_{ax}})=0.42~\mathrm{a.\!u.}$.
These values indicate predominantly ionic bonding. The graphs nicely show that the atoms appear as separate entities.
   
With that background it seems wrong arguing the bonding situation by forming covalent bonds, like they are assumed in MO or VB theory.
However, as wrong as it is to neglect ionic bonding, it is equally wrong to neglect covalent bonds.
The Orbitals of $\ce{IF7}$
There are a total of four orbitals with contributions from iodine and fluorine. There are not more than eight bonding electrons. I cannot imagine that Christe et. al. found a different solution, as his level of theory was not better (maybe worse). They either did not know how to interpret these results or simply overlooked it.
Here are the relevant lines from the output.
 Alpha occ 17 OE=-1.196 is I1-s=0.23 F7-s=0.18 F8-s=0.18
 Alpha occ 25 OE=-0.587 is I1-p=0.30 F7-p=0.28 F8-p=0.28
 Alpha occ 26 OE=-0.568 is I1-p=0.31 F4-p=0.19 F3-p=0.19
 Alpha occ 27 OE=-0.568 is I1-p=0.31 F2-p=0.21 F6-p=0.14 F5-p=0.14

(OE is the orbital eigenvalue in Hartree, the contributions missing from 1.00 are at the other atoms, but to small to trigger printing.)

In the LCAO bonding picture we have a totally symmetric bonding orbital from all atoms, an orbital referring to the axial bonds, and two degenerate orbitals for the equatorial plane.
Charges and Wiberg Bond indices
The ionic character of the bonds can also be seen in the charge distribution. While the iodine has a high positive charge $q(\ce{I})=3.24$, the fluorines have a negative charge $q(\ce{F})=-0.46$. These are AIM charges calculated with the MultiWFN program package.
The Analysis with natural bond orbitals give a similar result, $q(\ce{I})=3.20$, $q(\ce{F})=-0.46$.
Looking at the Wiberg bond indices matrix formed from natural atomic orbitals, we find a bond index of $0.54$ for the equatorial bonds and a slightly higher value of $0.56$ for the axial bonds.  
Conclusions
It is not possible to determine a number for how many sigma bonds are in the molecule, since this is strictly only possible for covalent bonds. The bonds are here predominantly ionic, with small covalent contributions. The number of bonding electrons does not exceed eight and therefore obeys the octet rule.
VSEPR fails, as it was expected. The term hyper-valency should be avoided and replaced by the term hyper-coordination."
what kind of suspension liquid should be used with ferrofluid (so it does not stain the glass),https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/409/what-kind-of-suspension-liquid-should-be-used-with-ferrofluid-so-it-does-not-st,55k,"I had success with the following:
1) Glass bottle, ideally with flat sides.  If you have a round bottle you may not be able to see the ferrofluid due to diffraction.
2) A solution of ~25% distilled water (a.k.a. deionized water) and ~75% of store bought isopropyl alcohol at 91% concentration.  That means that ~70% of my solution was actually isopropyl alcohol.  I eyeballed the ratio between the water and the isopropyl alcohol, those numbers are likely to not be exactly correct.
Procedure that I followed:
Add some isopropyl alcohol to the glass container.  Then add some (or all) of your ferrofluid to the container.  Then add some water to bring your isopropyl alcohol concentration to about 70%.  Next, use a magnet to settle the ferrofluid to the bottom and then remove the magnet.  If your ferrofluid has little bits that are floating, then you need to add more water.  If your ferrofluid looks too stringy then I would add more alcohol.  When I was done the ferrofluid had zero staining, like you see in the videos online, except for in a few spots.  I think for better results I would need a higher quality glass container.
notes: Don't put too much ferrofluid in your container, otherwise you will have an uninteresting blob.  I recommend using gloves.  To clean the ferrofluid stuff off my hands I used warm water, laundry detergent, and lots of scrubbing with a towel.  If you mess up, you can use a magnet to hold your ferrofluid in place while you pour off some of your suspension fluid.  In addition, you can use a straw and your thumb to pipet some of the ferrofluid, however some will get stuck in the straw, so I wouldn't do that unless you have a bunch of ferrofluid.  Finally, I only finished like 30 minutes ago, so I hope it will all look good tomorrow.  If something bad happens I will make another post.
notes, part 2: If all you want is a cool desk toy, then I recommend just buying one of the pre-made ferrofluid toys online. (I saw some for ~$30).  You will get a lot more ferrofluid for your money if you buy just the ferrofluid, however making the toy is a bit of work.
GOOD LUCK!

Why does milk overflow when boiled?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32529/why-does-milk-overflow-when-boiled,12k,"Milk contains surfactants (primarily lipids), which allow stable bubbles to form. In intense boiling, these bubbles can become mixed with liquid, supporting the liquid above them and forming what I'll call for want of a better term a ""wet froth."" Imagine a bunch of sponges made out of liquid. They take up more space than they would if you compressed them down and forced out the air. The inclusion of the water vapor in the bubbles lowers the density of the mixture, causing it to expand and overflow the pot.
The state is only stable because the added energy keeps creating new bubbles to replace any that have popped and keeps forcing liquid upward, while it would normally fall.
Water does not experience this mostly because its bubbles are far less stable. In fact, pure water does not form bubbles at all. The bubbles formed in water is typically due to impurities.  If you were to add soap to a boiling pot of water, you would see the exact same effect, if not worse."
Why is distillation not a viable way to separate ammonia from water?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/174/why-is-distillation-not-a-viable-way-to-separate-ammonia-from-water,19k,"Having embarrassed myself with my first answer, let me try this again. Ammonia and water hydrogen bond exceptionally well. In fact, the $\ce{O-H...N}$ value is 29 kJ/mol while the $\ce{O-H...O}$ value is 21 kJ/mol. (Ref) So, if there is any water around, ammonia would be happy to become solvated as they recondense. 
Also, ammonia is a weak base and reacts with water (which is not usually the case when you're doing a distillation). $$\ce{NH3 + H2O <=> NH4+ + OH-}$$ So, if there's any water around as the ammonia is distilling and they recombine, they would also react which would make it difficult to remove the last of the water. (Some reaction would occur because the lowest energy point of the equilibrium is not at reactants or products.)
So, as noted in the comments, distillations to prepare dry ammonia use a scrubber to remove the water."

Silver and milk (or milk products),https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/513/silver-and-milk-or-milk-products,23k,"You're right: the silver is reacting with sulfur compounds in the food to form a tarnish of silver sulfide. This is most commonly observed, in my experience, using silver teaspoons with boiled eggs, which are pretty rich in sulfur.
There are a number of reactions that can take place depending on the sulfur-containing species - the abstract from this paper from the Journal of Chemical Education (unfortunately pay-walled) has a nice example:

Silver and silver-plated objects react with sulfur and sulfur compounds to produce silver sulfide $\ce{Ag2S}$ or tarnish. Contact with materials that contain sulfur compounds, such as hard boiled eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, and rubber bands can cause tarnish. In the air, a silver object can tarnish owing to the reaction of silver with hydrogen sulfide ($\ce{H2S}$). This is a gas found in the air as a result of some industrial processes and the decomposition of dead plants and animals. The reaction of silver with hydrogen sulfide to form tarnish is as follows:
$\ce{2 Ag(s) + H2S(g) -> Ag2S(s) + H2(g)}$

In Sterling silver specifically, you'll often also get copper sulfide formed.
The paper also mentions that you can remove the tarnish abrasively, or through reacting the tarnish with aluminium (via solution, electrochemically):

$\ce{3 Ag2S(s) + 2 Al(s) -> 6 Ag(s) + Al2S3(s)}$

But a more common approach used by many commercial products is to dissolve off the tarnish, usually in sodium thiosulfate or thiourea. This means you end up with slightly less silver on your item, but is otherwise pretty effective and very mild (it's commonly used for museum pieces)."
Is Hydrogen Bonding a Type of Dipole Dipole Interaction?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/35488/is-hydrogen-bonding-a-type-of-dipole-dipole-interaction,14k,"Well, it turns out that this is a very active area of research. I will only summarize what I understand to be true about the covalent nature of the hydrogen bond, so I'm sure the explanation could be more detailed and potentially more accurate in some places (I hope someone gives a more detailed answer), but here's what I've got.
As you said, it has been found that the hydrogen bond (specifically in water) is about 90% electrostatic and 10% covalent. See this link for a sort-of-review/overview of hydrogen bonding and some relevant research.
Upon following the paper trail, I found the following research article: E.D. Isaacs, A. Shukla, P.M. Platzman, D.R. Hamann, B. Barbiellini, C.A. Tulk, J. Phys. Chem. Solids, 2000, 61, 403-406. (Mirror)
Essentially, they use some method which I don't really understand and find quite conclusive evidence of the (word of the day) anisotropy of hydrogen bonds. That means that the bond is indeed directionally dependent. Bond direction is one defining characteristic of covalent bonds.
That raises the question of what is going on with the orbitals that allow for hydrogen to participate in more than one covalent bond at a time.
A simple explanation of the orbital interactions for a water dimer is to view the oxygen 2p,2s hybridized orbital as having superposition with the hydrogen 1s orbital and then interacting covalently with that same 2p,2s hybridized orbital on the other oxygen in the dimer. This superposition which includes the hydrogen then explains the way that hydrogen is participating in one covalent bond and another partially covalent interaction.
Furthermore, this explanation of what the orbitals are doing fits well with what we would expect from a hydrogen participating in two different covalent interactions, which is that the energy curve has two minima where one is much deeper than the other.
Further evidence for the covalent nature of the bond is the fact that the O-H bond elongation and O---H hydrogen bond length always change together. That is, as the O-H bond lengthens, the O---H interaction length shortens. This implies a shift in electron density towards hydrogen which is most easily explained by a delocalization of electrons participating in a covalent interaction.
So, I hope that's a good start toward understanding the covalent nature of the hydrogen bond--it was for me!
But to answer the simple part of the question which you clearly already know is that yes dipole-dipole is a significant part of hydrogen bonding, and it certainly should be, but as is always true of chemistry, there's a lot more going on than what one might initially think.

EDIT (06/01/2016)
Since I posted this answer, I think I have developed a better understanding of the situation, and feel obliged to update my answer. First, let me split hydrogen-bonding into two obvious parts, electrostatic and covalent characteristics. This is an obvious split, but it is not completely clear yet what we mean by covalent, so let us try to define that by looking at some examples. Furthermore, we must be careful when talking in about hydrogen-bonding because in every hydrogen bond there is a donor and acceptor, and these two roles are often played best by different chemical species.
Hydrogen-Bonding in thiols
Here we go breaking yet another rule. They told us that sulfur couldn't hydrogen bond. Well, that's not exactly true. Okay, but that hydrogen-bonding has got to be basically negligible right? Not exactly.
The first thing we need to do here is get some information. First, sulfur has an electronegativity of 2.58 on the Pauling scale. This is roughly the same as the electronegativity of carbon which we do not consider to hydrogen-bond well. So, if there are hydrogen-bonds involving sulfur, we should expect that they will be primarily covalent as any dipole interactions will be pretty small.
As it turns out, sulfur is a much better hydrogen-bond acceptor than it is donor, and at times is a comparable acceptor to oxygen. Here is a table comparing certain dimers from a great source you can reference at the bottom of the page$^3$.

As you can see, when the sulfur in these dimers (which are all named in the caption of the table) acts a hydrogen bond acceptor, the shift in vibrational frequency of the $\ce{O-H}$ and the binding energy are comparable to when an oxygen is the acceptor atom.
Looking at other research$^4$ involving sulfur hydrogen bonds reveals that approximately 70% of the interaction energy between sulfur and oxygen when sulfur is the acceptor comes from dispersion. That is the key physical insight in all this. Despite the loss of electronegativity, sulfur gains something in its greater dispersion interactions which makes it a good hydrogen bond acceptor. It should be noted, however, that the electronegative component of these hydrogen-bonds maintains their directionality.
Also, to compare, according to that wikipedia article I linked, the interaction energy of a water dimer is only 24% dispersion. In water electrostatics dominate and induction and exchange play meaningful roles.
Conclusions
I have more I could say, but it's perhaps a longer explanation than is worth going into. To conclude, what is meant by covalent interactions in hydrogen-bonding varies based on the species you are considering. In something like water, we can think about this in the usual way by saying that there must be some orbital overlap and hence electronic exchange which will be stabilizing. With other species, we can see that what we mean by covalent interactions might be different. That is, there is still some orbital overlap, but we must also consider non-electrostatic interactions like dispersion.

Side reactions of N-hydroxysuccinimide esters with nucleophiles,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/423/side-reactions-of-n-hydroxysuccinimide-esters-with-nucleophiles,12k,"The reactivity of NHS activated esters has mostly been desribed quite anecdotically. They are susceptible to hydrolysis in water, the kinetics of which is dependent on the nature of the NHS activated group (ester vs carnonate vs carbamate) as well as on the pH of the reaction buffer1, which is one way to show that primary amines are not the only nucleophile which can react with NHS-activated esters.
As for the chemical groups that have been observed to react with NHS activated esters, I did find a couple of examples upon looking up this issue. For instance, the Zenobi group have attempted a quite systematic study on the groups that can react with doubly NHS activated cross-linkers. Citing the abstract2 :

As soon as additional cross-linkers were attached or loops were formed, other amino acids were also involved in the reaction. In addition to the primary amino groups, serine, threonine and tyrosine showed significant reactivity due to the effect of neighboring amino acids by intermediate or permanent Type-1 cross-link formation. The reactivity is highly dependent on the pH and on adjacent amino acids.

In an earlier work, the reactivity of a biotinylation NHS-ester based reagent was assessed on a single peptide,  [D-Lys(6)]gonadotropin releasing hormone. A similar reactivity of -OH groups was observed, with in addition that of the arginine guanidinium group3:

In addition to the O-acylation of Ser(4) and Tyr(5) in this peptide, we have also identified a novel biotinylation of the Arg(8) side chain.

Other groups have also observed some reactivity with cysteins (sulfhydryl groups), but in a situation where the reagent is included within a ligand of the target protein. One can assume, as do the authors, that specific positionning of the ligand within the binding site can lead to binding with a cystein group4,5.
From these earlier work, one cas conclude, in answer to your question that although primary amines are the most reactive group for NHS-ester derivatization, other groups present in peptide side-chains (-OH for tyrosine, serine, threonine, guanidinium for arginine and sulfhydryls for cysteins).
The last issue raised in the question remains that of the secondary amine groups. It is widely accepted that pH influences strongly the kinetics of NHS derivatization, mostly through protonation of the amine groups which cannot act as nucleophiles in protonated state. This has been put to use in controlling the buffer pH in order to favor N-terminal reaction vs lysine side chain reaction. Although, in my experience, it is not at all a straightforward experiment and it is highly dependent on the nature of the derivatization group. One could hypothesize that since secondary amines are more basic then primary amines, the reactivity of secondary amines towards NHS should be reduced compared to primary amines, but I have no experimental or litterature proof for this part of the answer."
Iron chemistry: acetates for ebonizing wood,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/35351/iron-chemistry-acetates-for-ebonizing-wood,22k,"Ok, without going through all of this experimentally I'll shoot from the hip knowing some chemistry.
(1) With this coloration you don't want a paint that sits on top of the wood. 
(2) The desire is to get the iron to wick into the cellulose fibers.
(3) An iron-acetate complex must wick better than a iron ion (or else you could use iron chloride). 
The gist here that an iron ion isn't floating around in a water solution as a ""free"" ion. It really has water molecules which are ""bonded"" to the atom to form a ""complex."" The acetate complex must wick better, probably because it is overall uncharged. So you basically can't wick $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ into the wood and leave $\ce{Cl^{-}}$ in the solution. 
(4) If the pH of the solution gets too low, then iron hydroxides form. 
(5) The overall reaction of the acetic acid to dissolve the steel wool is:
$$\ce{Fe} + \ce{H^+}\ce{OAc^+} \ce{->} \ce{Fe^{2+}}\ce{OAc^{-}_2} + \ce{H_2}$$
The point in (5) is that the reaction consumes $\ce{H^+}$ and the pH will increase (i.e. the solution is less acidic). 
I suspect that if the pH gets too low then nasty things happen. I think you want to use pickling vinegar with is 10% acetic acid, not household vinegar which is only 3%. For consistency you also don't want to leave excess steel wool in the solution forever. I'd guess figure on about a 75% reaction. So figure out much steel wool would react with 75% of all of the acetic acid and use that much steel wool. That will insure that you have excess acetic acid which will dry off the ppt. 
The staining solution is probably unstable, so just mix what you want to use within some ""short"" period of time. 
The dry solid should be stable if stored in a ""sealed"" container."

"In rovibrational spectra, when exactly is the Q branch forbidden?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/83021/in-rovibrational-spectra-when-exactly-is-the-q-branch-forbidden,11k,"To determine the intensity of a rotation-vibration transition, you need to consider the transition momentum integral $\int \psi_f \hat{\mu} \psi_i d\tau$, where $\psi_f$ is the final state, $\psi_i$ is the initial state, $\hat{\mu}$ is the transition dipole moment operator, and $d\tau$ indicates integration over all space. Assuming separation of vibrational and rotational motion, this factors into the product of two terms: one that specifies the intensity of the vibrational transition and another that specifies the intensity of the rotational transition. The vibrational integral leads to a selection rule $\Delta v = \pm 1$ (in the harmonic approximation) and the rotational integral leads to a selection rule $\Delta J = \pm 1$. So no Q branch occurs. However, if there is some additional source of angular momentum (e.g., from vibrations or electronic motion) then it is possible to have a Q branch because now that extra motion can contribute to the total angular momentum in a way that allows the Q branch to occur.
So here is the rule that you ask for: a Q branch will not occur in transitions between $\Sigma$ electronic states of a diatomic molecule, but can occur in transitions between $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$ states. Since vibration-rotation transitions by definition occur within a single electronic state, Q branches do not occur in vibration-rotation spectra of diatomic molecules in a $\Sigma$ state. In a polyatomic molecule, however, vibrational modes can carry angular momentum so even within a single electronic state that carries no electronic angular momentum it may be possible to observe Q branches in a vibration-rotation spectrum so long as the vibration being excited is one which carries nuclear orbital angular momentum (e.g., from a vibrationless ground state to a vibrationally excited bending mode)."

When are two orbitals orthogonal?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/64445/when-are-two-orbitals-orthogonal,20k,"Unfortunately, the sense in which orbitals are orthogonal is more or less impossible to define rigorously without recourse to functions of some kind.  So, I'll give an explanation a shot using some simple, 1-D functions to illustrate the concept, followed by the pictorial orbital example you've asked for.
At a basic level, in order to have any two functions be orthogonal, you need to define a ""mixing rule"" for them. The most useful mixing rule for orbitals turns out to be integrating the product of the two functions$^\dagger$ over some defined domain.
So, consider two real 1-D functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, defined over an interval $x=[a,b]$. The mixing rule $\Pi\,_a^b\!\left(f,g\right)$ I'll define as follows:
$$
\Pi\,_a^b\!\left(f,g\right) \rightarrow \int_a^b{f(x)g(x)\, dx}
$$
Simply put, two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are orthogonal under the mixing rule $\Pi\,_a^b$ (or any other mixing rule!) if and only if $\Pi\,_a^b\!\left(f,g\right) = 0$.
A pretty standard example of two orthogonal functions in this framework would be the following:
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= \cos(2\pi x) \\
  g(x) &= \sin(2\pi x) \\
  a    &= 0 \\
  b    &= 1
\end{align*}
The integral to check from the above is:
$$
\Pi\,_0^1\!\left(f, g\right) \rightarrow \int_0^1{\cos(2\pi x)\, \sin(2\pi x)\, dx}
$$
Since this is Stack Exchange and not a math exam, I will now cheat and just link to Wolfram Alpha to demonstrate that the above integral is, indeed, zero. Thus, on the domain $x=[0,1]$, $\sin(2\pi x)$ and $\cos(2\pi x)$ are orthogonal.
On the other hand, to pick some random examples, $f(x)=-x$ and $g(x)=\ln(x)$ are not orthogonal on the interval $x=[0,1]$.
$$
\Pi\,_0^1\!\left(f,g\right) \rightarrow \int_0^1{\left(-x\right)\ln(x)\, dx} = 0.25
$$
Similarly, the original two functions are not orthogonal on the interval $x=[0.2,0.9]$:
$$
\Pi\,_{0.2}^{0.9}\!\left(f, g\right) \rightarrow \int_{0.2}^{0.9}{\cos(2\pi x)\, \sin(2\pi x)\, dx} = -0.0444852
$$

Ok, enough with the math lesson. How does this help define orthogonal orbitals?
Well, orbitals, both atomic and molecular, are (usually) defined just as as 3-D functions over all space.  If you have two orbitals $\phi\!\left(\vec r\right)$ and $\psi\!\left(\vec r\right)$ and want to know if they're orthogonal, you use a mixing rule somewhat similar to $\Pi$ above and calculate the appropriate integral. If the resulting value is zero, then the orbitals are orthogonal.
For example, consider a $1\mathrm s$ and a $2\mathrm p$ orbital (yes, these are atomic orbitals, but the principle holds for molecular orbitals, too):

Here, the colors of the two lobes of the $2\mathrm p$ orbital are important: one color, say orange, represents positive function values; the other, say blue, represents negative values.  For the $1\mathrm s$ orbital, though, it's all orange, or all positive).
What happens if, per $\Pi\!\left(\phi, \psi\right)$, you center these two orbitals on top of one another, multiply their values together, and integrate over all space? Well, the half of the $\mathrm p$ orbital that is positive will result in positive contributions to the integral of $\Pi$, and the half of the $\mathrm p$ orbital that is negative will provide negative contributions to the $\Pi$ integral.  And, further, due to the spherical symmetry of the $\mathrm s$ orbital and the reflection symmetry of the $\mathrm p$ orbital, those two positive and negative contributions will exactly cancel. Thus, the $1\mathrm s$ and $2\mathrm p$ atomic orbitals are orthogonal.

Epilogue: So, given all of this, why do we also say that vectors that are $90^\circ$ from one another are orthogonal?
Well, it just involves a different mixing rule (the domain is implicit, deriving from the dimensionality of the two vectors, which must be the same):
$$
\Gamma\!\left(\vec v_1, \vec v_2\right) \rightarrow \vec v_1\cdot\vec v_2
$$
Under the (extraordinarily common) mixing rule $\Gamma\!\left(\vec v_1, \vec v_2\right)$, the two vectors $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$ are said to be orthogonal  when $\vec v_1\cdot\vec v_2=0$.

Note: In theory, I could have just linked to this question on Math.SE. However, none of the answers there were really couched in suitably readable terms.

How can I clean my lab coat?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10419/how-can-i-clean-my-lab-coat,27k,"A lab coat will eventually get dirty, that's why it is a good idea to wear it. I had a lot of students complaining about the condition of their coat and they asked me if they could just wash it in the washing machine. My answer was always no. 
As far as I remember - I am a theoretician now - a labcoat costs much less than a pair of trousers and a T-shirt. It should be renewed annually and disposed of according to the norms how you would dispose of an unknown chemical. You never know where the chemicals incorporated in your coat will end up, so dispose of them as safely as you can.
In some countries, it is required by the employer to provide equipment like that and taking care of either cleaning or disposing of it eventually. (In Germany that should be the case.) Wear it as a disposable layer of protection and please - for the safety of the environment and yourself - do never ever put it in a normal washing machine again.

As an additional note, if you wash it in the same washer like your normal clothes, how can you assure that it will not end up in your everyday clothes? I can imagine, that having chromium whatever in my underwear would not make me feel alright."
Migratory aptitude in pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10833/migratory-aptitude-in-pinacol-pinacolone-rearrangement,50k,"In the pinacol rearrangement, a 1,2-diol is treated with acid and rearranges to a carbonyl compound. Here is a reaction scheme showing a mechanism for the rearrangement.

In this case the molecule is symmetric and methyl migration is the only reaction pathway available.  Methyl migration can 1) help stabilize the developing carbocation center and 2) once fully migrated, produces a resonance stabilized hydroxyl-carbocation.
If one or more of the methyl groups is replaced with some other substituent (for example, alkyl, hydrogen, aryl), then our reaction possibilities become more complex; which hydroxyl group will protonate, which group will migrate?  Generally, both hydroxyls will protonate and lead to separate products.  In terms of which group will migrate, the only thing agreed upon is that a tertiary carbon will migrate in preference to a secondary carbon which will migrate in preference to a primary carbon.  Clearly, the ability of the migrating group to stabilize positive charge plays a role.
The reaction is reversible and product distribution can change as reaction conditions are changed (thermodynamic control vs. kinetic control).  All of these complexities make it difficult to sort things out in detail, thereby making it difficult to determine the true relative migratory preference of other groups like H and phenyl.  This is why the migratory aptitudes of these groups (H and phenyl) can change from textbook to textbook.
See section 2. Pinacol Rearrangement in this reference for a very nice, straightforward discussion of this reaction mechanism, and all its subtleties."
Do lone pairs on substituents (e.g. in aniline) count towards Hückel's rule?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/16757/do-lone-pairs-on-substituents-e-g-in-aniline-count-towards-h%c3%bcckels-rule,13k,"It is only the electrons from atoms in the ring that count when applying Huckel's rule. Electrons from substituents on the ring are only cross-conjugated with the aromatic π-system. When you think of it in terms of perturbational molecular orbital theory the substituent electrons take the part of a perturbation for the ring's aromatic system.
The reason for only using the ring electrons traces back to the origin of aromaticity. Take a look at the π-orbital energy levels of benzene (figure taken from p 36 of Fleming, Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions, Reference Edition):

Here, $\alpha$ is the energy of an isolated p-orbital and $\beta$ is the stabilization energy of the π-bond in ethylene. You can see that for benzene you get the best stabilization if you have 6 π electrons ($4n + 2$ for $n=1$) in the system because then you fill the stabilized MOs $\psi_1$, $\psi_2$ and $\psi_3$ which are lower in energy than an isolated p-orbital and gain the maximum stabilization energy possible. If you'd have more electrons in the system you would have to fill the destabilized MOs $\psi^{*}_{4}$, $\psi^{*}_{5}$ and $\psi^{*}_{6}$ which would cost a lot of energy because of the large energy gap between the bonding and antibonding MOs.
Now, what happens if you add a cross-conjugating substituent to the ring. This can be seen in the (Huckel-)MO-diagram of styrene (Fleming, p 71).

The main effects of the substituent are that the degeneracies of some orbitals are lifted and that the orbital energies shift a bit, especially those of HOMO and LUMO are of interest. In the case of styrene the HOMO lies higher in energy and the LUMO lies lower in energy compared to benzene. Now there are 4 stabilized energy levels instead of 3 - any electron that occupies one of those levels will lead to a stabilization of the molecule. But that is nice and well as you get 2 electrons from the substituent which will want to occupy one of the 4 levels and that leaves you with 3 levels that have to be occupied by ring electrons. Thus, your system will be most stable if the π-system of the ring contains 6 electrons, exactly like in benzene. Any more than 6 electrons will lead to destabilization as there is still quite a big HOMO–LUMO gap (even though it is smaller than in benzene).
The argument I made for styrene will remain valid for other molecules with different substituents (like aniline). The MO scheme of aniline will look a little different but the essential features should be the same."

Is pure water very corrosive?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/7467/is-pure-water-very-corrosive,52k,"That quote had false statements all over it.
Type I ultra pure water (Milli-Q water, or others) are fairly common among all labs.  They are not corrosive to stainless steel.  
As @chipbuster said, purified water is never distributed through stainless steel partly because concern of contamination.  Metal reacts not only with oxygen, but also many pollutants in the air.  Overtime on metal surface will build up a layer that has all kind of compounds in them.  When water flows through, ions get picked up.  
However, the most major reason would be that glass is better in all respect.  The reason glasswares are commonly used in the lab have little to do with pure water.   Glasswares are relatively stable across wide range of pH and very hard to be oxidized or reduced.   Plus, glasswares are cheap, extremely easy to manufacture, and transparent, so you can see through.  You will really only need metal if extreme pressure or temperature is required.
As a matter of fact, it is also unwise to use glassware to distribute ultrapure water--you will get ion contaminations from glass as well.  Purified water are actually almost always stored in plastic containers and distributed through plastic tubes."
Shape of the P1/2 Orbital,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/58135/shape-of-the-p1-2-orbital,10k,"As orthocresol mentioned, this is all about relativity, so let's talk about it. I am hardly an expert myself, but I'll try to give an answer to the best of my limited knowledge. For an interesting and accessible overview of the incorporation of relativistic effects into chemistry, I recommend the 2012 review article ""Relativistic Effects in Chemistry: More Common Than You Thought"" by Pekka Pyykkö (free access!), one of the great names in the field.
The theoretical basis for most of our work as chemists is ""old"" quantum mechanics, developed up to around 1925, and one of the hallmarks of this era is the Schrödinger equation. The whole concept of orbitals comes as the solution of the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom, (i.e. a two-body system composed of an electron in a spherically symmetric electric field originating from the nucleus). The stationary states in this system are spherical harmonics, described by the quantum numbers $n$, $l$ and $m$ (or $m_l$). The first two numbers determine the shape of the orbital, but we've gotten used to calling the second number by a letter (s, p, d, f, g, ... for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). So that's what orbital names, such as $\textbf{4s}$, $\textbf{3d}$ and $\textbf{5f}$ mean.
That said, old quantum mechanics is fundamentally incomplete, in a way which very much matters to chemists. In particular, in 1922 the Stern-Gerlach experiment discovered the property of spin. While its existence could be accommodated within the prior framework by ""tacking it on"" and adding an extra quantum number $s$, there was no theoretical background to explain it. This changed a few years later, when Paul Dirac incorporated special relativity into quantum mechanics. Old quantum mechanics implicitly assumes the speed of light is infinite, and by adequately introducing its finitude, many new experimentally-verified phenomena appear, such as antiparticles and, indeed, spin. In other words, spin is a purely relativistic quantum mechanical property! 
The equivalent of the Schrödinger equation in relativistic quantum mechanics is the Dirac equation. Much like the Schrödinger equation, the Dirac equation can be solved for a two-body system composed of an electron in a spherically-symmetric electric field created by the nucleus. The resulting solutions (""Dirac orbitals""), however, are somewhat different. In particular, the quantum numbers $l$ and $s$ are no longer ""good"" quantum numbers (that is, they no longer describe stationary states, due to spin-orbit coupling), but their sum ($\overrightarrow{j}=\overrightarrow{l}+\overrightarrow{s}$) is. For the electron, $s=\frac{1}{2}$, and thus for each value of $l$, there are now two possible values of $j$, given by $|l+\frac{1}{2}|$ and $|l-\frac{1}{2}|$. This means that the s, p, d, f... subshells from the Schrödinger solutions are now split according to their $j$ values. The s subshells are unique in that they don't split ($|0+\frac{1}{2}| = |0-\frac{1}{2}| = \frac{1}{2}$), but are now termed $\textbf{s}_{1/2}$ subshells. The p subshells, which are triply degenerate via the Schrödinger equation, now split into a single $\textbf{p}_{1/2}$ orbital and two degenerate $\textbf{p}_{3/2}$ orbitals. The d subshells, previously quintuply degenerate, split into two degenerate $\textbf{d}_{3/2}$ orbitals and three degenerate $\textbf{d}_{5/2}$ orbitals. The trend continues similarly for the further subshells. Here is a figure from ""Relativistic quantum chemistry: The electrons and the nodes"", which will hopefully make it clearer:

So what are the physical consequences of these different mathematical solutions? Firstly, the orbitals change in energy. Orbitals with a lower $j$ for a given $n$ and $l$ have lower energy (e.g., the single $\textbf{4p}_{1/2}$ orbital is lower in energy than the two degenerate $\textbf{4p}_{3/2}$ orbitals). The shape of the orbitals also change; all orbitals with $j=\frac{1}{2}$ are spherical, regardless of $l$.
According to ""Contour diagrams for relativistic orbitals"":

Contour plots for $^2P_{1/2}$ and $^2S_{1/2}$ are spherically symmetrical,  while those for $n = 2$ and $3$, $l = 1$, $j= 3/2$, and
  $m = \pm 3/2$ look very similar to those for p orbitals already published in this journal.

Similarly, all orbitals with $j=\frac{3}{2}$ are dumbbell-shaped, including $\textbf{d}_{3/2}$ orbitals. The article brings a helpful schematic:

As additional confirmation, ""Pictorial Representations of the Dirac Electron Cloud for Hydrogen-Like Atoms"" states:

As an example of these two theorems the angular charge distributions for the magnetic states $m = \pm 3/2$ for a $^2P_{3/2}$ term are not only the same but are also identical with the two magnetic states $m = \pm 3/2$ of the $^2D_{3/2}$ term. It should be pointed out that the radial charge distributions of the $^2P$ and $^2D$ terms are different. [...]
  In this connection one of the consequences of the Dirac theory is that
  a single p electron or two similar p electrons, depending on whether $j=\frac{1}{2}$ or
  $j=\frac{3}{2}$ respectively, present spherical symmetry. Not only are all S states
  spherically symmetrical, as on the Schrodinger theory, but also all one electron systems having but one valence electron and that electron in a $^2P_{1/2}$ state,
  eg., the normal states of B, Al, Ga, In, Tl.

The article also shows a table of the angular distribution functions for the wavefunction. Note how the function is equal to $1$ for $\textbf{s}_{1/2}$ and $\textbf{p}_{1/2}$ orbitals. That is, there is no angular dependence, implying spherical symmetry.

The article also brings some diagrams and pictures of simulated orbital shapes.


I wouldn't be able to tell you why this is the case any more than I would be able to explain the shapes for the solutions to the Schrödinger equation - that's just how it pans out.
Another difference is that the Dirac orbitals do not possess nodal points or planes. They are now replaced with ""pseudo-nodes"", where the wavefunction assumes very small values, but never reaches zero anywhere. This is nicely shown in this figure from ""Relativistic quantum chemistry: The electrons and the nodes"":"
Why is a singlet state called singlet and a triplet state called triplet?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10339/why-is-a-singlet-state-called-singlet-and-a-triplet-state-called-triplet,31k,"The terms arose back in the early days of quantum physics when spectral lines that were expected to be singlets were actually observed to be more complex (doublets, triplets, etc.).  
An electron can have a spin quantum number of $+\frac12$ or $-\frac12$.  For a system that exists as a singlet, all spins are paired and the total spin for the system is $S=0$.  If we have a single electron, $S=\frac12$.  If we have a triplet system with 2 unpaired electrons, $S=1$.  Also associated with these electrons/ systems is a spin-angular momentum vector, $L$.  Quantum mechanics tells us that $L$ is allowed to have $2S+1$ distinct values.  So
for a singlet, $L = 2(0) + 1 = 1$     only one state exists (singlet)
for a doublet, $L = 2\left(\frac12\right) + 1 = 2$   two states exist (doublet)

"Why is sand, sand; and why is glass, glass; While both mainly contain Silicon Dioxide?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/21951/why-is-sand-sand-and-why-is-glass-glass-while-both-mainly-contain-silicon-di,11k,"Is it crystallization?

You are correct. The main difference is that sand is crystalline and glass is not—it is amorphous.
The main component (> 95%) of common yellow sand is quartz (the mineral whose composition is SiO2). Note that not all sand is quartz. There are white sands containing calcite (CaCO3) and black sand (containing various heavy minerals). But the most common sand is indeed quartz sand: SiO2.
Glass, the type you see in your everyday life, on the other hand, is not composed of pure SiO2. It has a bunch of other additives such as Na, K, B, and others. This is done to modify the properties of the glass and make it more suitable for human use. It doesn't matter much though for our discussion.
So if they are made of the same thing, why the difference? The answer is cooling rate. If you cool molten SiO2 slow enough, the atoms have enough time to organize themselves into a crystalline structure. In the case of pure SiO2, this is a network of SiO4 tetrahedra: One silicon atom surrounded by four oxygens. If it cools too fast, then the crystalline structure does not form. It may be completely amorphous, or form into a sub-microscopic array of SiO2 crystals in various structures (CT-opal for example).
What determines the cooling rate? Well, in the case of glass it is a matter of minutes. You've seen glass making: The glass is molten and very quickly it solidifies to a solid. In contrast, most of the quartz sand you're seeing is actually broken fragments of rocks called granite. This type of rock has abundant quartz in it, and it forms deep underground (as in 10s of kilometers) at very slow cooling rates. While a glass maker can take his glass and let it cool in the atmosphere or in water, molten silicate magma (""glass"") deep in the Earth is surrounded by rocks that are in the hundreds of degrees. This slow cooling facilitates crystallization of the SiO2 into quartz rather than glass. How slow is this? At least tens of years, more commonly hundreds or even thousands of years. This is much slower than the seconds and minutes in glass making.
Slow crystallization of SiO2 in the Earth is not the only process. There are actually processes that can take molten silicate magma and cool it very rapidly. This commonly happens in volcanic settings: A volcano throws molten magma (again, made mostly out of SiO2) and throws it into the atmosphere where it can cool very rapidly. It's even faster if the magma erupts into water. The result is volcanic glass: sometimes called obsidian.
The difference in the visual appearance is actually not due to the presence or absence of a crystalline structure. It's mostly related to grain size. If you take window glass and shatter it so it's all small grains, it will look just like sand. On the other hand, if you take quartz, and make it big and smooth (just like window glass), it will look like this:

Are geminal disubstituted alkenes more stable than their cis/trans isomers?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/24520/are-geminal-disubstituted-alkenes-more-stable-than-their-cis-trans-isomers,15k,"This is a very good question and if popular books give conflicting answers, then it must be reasoned out. Unfortunately, Paula Bruice has given the wrong answer while the other two books have given no explanation for this comparison.
For the answer I assume that you know about hyperconjugation and the various contributing structures it involves.  This gives a basic idea of hyperconjugation:  

Source: tutorcircle.com 
Note that on hyperconjugation, the other carbon of the alkene gets a negative charge on it.
If the hyperconjugation structures of 2-methylprop-1-ene and trans-but-2-ene are drawn:


you will notice that:

$ \ce{C_1} $ of the former has a negative charge on it 
$ \ce{C_2} $ of the latter has a negative charge on it 
The latter's methyl group makes the negatve charge less stable due to +I (inductive effect) 
The former has no such destablizing effect as the carbon containing the negative charge is just connected to hydrogens
As all the hyperconjugation structure have this effect applying on them, the net effect cant be ignored for the overall stability 

Hence the overall stability of  2-methylprop-1-ene > trans-but-2-ene"
"Why does NaBH4 reduce double bonds conjugated to carbonyl groups, while LiAlH4 does not?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6977/why-does-nabh4-reduce-double-bonds-conjugated-to-carbonyl-groups-while-lialh4-d,50k,"Neither $\ce{LiAlH_4}$ nor $\ce{NaBH4}$ are able to reduce an isolated $\ce{C=C}$ bond. But if you have an enal (a conjugated aldehyde) it can react (as an electrophile) either at the β-carbon or at the carbonyle group's carbon. According to the HSAB Principle the β-carbon is a “soft” center and would react preferably with “soft” nucleophiles while the carbonyle carbon is a “hard” center and prefers to react with “hard” nucleophiles.
Now, $\ce{NaBH4}$ is a rather soft nucleophile and thus it reacts with an enal at the β-carbon. After this reaction the $\ce{C=C}$ bond is gone. But what is left behind is still a very reactive simple aldehyde that gets reduced to the alcohol by $\ce{NaBH4}$ in a second step.
$\ce{LiAlH4}$ on the other hand is a rather hard nucleophile and thus reacts with an enal at the carbonyl carbon. After this reaction there is just an isolated double bond left that can't be reduced by $\ce{LiAlH4}$ in a second step."
Migratory aptitude in Baeyer-Villiger reaction,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6269/migratory-aptitude-in-baeyer-villiger-reaction,19k,"The migratory aptitude list for the Baeyer-Villager oxidation is as it is because that is how the molecules undergoing the reaction behave. When we are learning about new reactions from a textbook, we often read about the mechanism and theoretical explanations of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity. It is easy to forget that the experimental observations came first.
The migratory aptitude list $(\ce{H>R3C>R2HC}\approx\ce{Ph(>H)>RCH2>Me})$ is the result of many experiments. Nor is it a linear list as is usually presented. $\ce{H}$ migrates more readily than tertiary groups, which migrate more readily than secondary groups, which migrate more readily than phenyl groups (which migrate more readily than $\ce{H}$).
The mechanism and theoretical explanations came later. The partially complete mechanism from the Wikipedia page is shown below. The key step (center) is a concerted collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate with a [1,2]-sigmatropic shift of $\ce{R}^1$ and ejection of the carboxylate leaving group. Note that this mechanism shows none of the proton transfer steps.

Since the whole thing is supposedly concerted, I can understand your objection to the build-up of $\delta^+$ on $\ce{R}^1$. However, with the exceptions of the anomalous behavior of $\ce{H}$ and $\ce{Ph}$, the migratory aptitude list is the same as the carbocation stability list. Thus, researchers looked for a link between the two phenomena and a way to relate one to the other. The link may not be real, but the trends are there. To a student learning organic chemistry, it is much friendlier at first to apply an existing trend in reactivity to a new reaction (with an exception), than to learn a whole new trend that is unrelated but cosmetically similar."
Can hydrogen on platinum reduce carboxylic acids and esters?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/75091/can-hydrogen-on-platinum-reduce-carboxylic-acids-and-esters,22k,"This is based off my memory, as far as I can remember what my teacher taught me.

Note, instead of $\ce{Pt}$, you can go for $\ce{Ni}$ (or Raney Nickel) or even $\ce{Pd}$ as a catalyst.
Functional groups such as acid halide, cyanide, nitro, aldehyde, ketone, alkene, and alkyne are easily reduced by $\ce{H2/Ni}$.  Some other groups can be reduced with $\ce{H2/Ni}$ as well, but if someone's asking you a question in an exam, they want you to refer to the list of groups which are easily reduced (more in the reactivity order below).  So the answer in your case would be a no.
Next, here's a reactivity order:
First, the groups which are easily reduced:
$$\begin{align} \text{acid halide} > \ce{R-C#C-R} > \ce{R-C=C-R} > \ce{R-CHO} > \\ &\text{ketone}>  \ce{R-CN} > \ce{R-NO2} > \ldots \end{align}$$

$$ \ldots > \ce{R-X} > \text{benzene} > \ce{R-COOH} > \text{amide} > \text{ester} > \text{acid anhydride}$$
$\ce{R-X}$ would require temperatures around $\pu{50^\circ C}$, benzene would require a temperature of about $\pu{100^\circ C}$ and groups from carboxylic acid to acid anhydride would require temperatures around $200-\pu{250^\circ C}$."
Are there any major exceptions when comparing electron affinity?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/163/are-there-any-major-exceptions-when-comparing-electron-affinity,44k,"This exception rule is actually orbital filling rule.

Why is the bond order of CO+ 3.5?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/35641/why-is-the-bond-order-of-co-3-5,50k,"For a long time it was taught in school and universities that the HOMO of carbon monoxide is anti-bonding. Without more context it was also often taught that the bond order in CO is three, since there are eight electrons in bonding orbitals and two in anti-bonding orbitals. $$\text{Bond order} = \frac12(\text{bonding} - \text{anti-bonding})$$
By assuming that the HOMO is anti-bonding (it is not!) and taking away one electron, the  bond order has to increase to 3.5. This is wrong.
When we have a look at the MO diagram, a calculated version can be found here, we know that the HOMO, i.e. 3σ, is a bonding orbital, while the anti-bonding orbital is the 2σ. Upon ionisation, we would indeed remove one bonding electron and therefore the bond order has to decrease to 2.5 as you suggested.
However, it is not that easy. Strictly speaking the below MO scheme is, as well as MO theory itself, an approximation, and only one possible configuration. While we do not have to use resonance structures with MO theory, we have to consider other configurations (analogous to excited states). So naturally the bond order of CO is not strictly 3. And removing an electron does not mean we are removing it from only one orbital, rather than decreasing the electron density. Therefore we cannot accurately predict the bond order with these simple considerations.
Experimental observations and theoretical calculations suggest that the bond indeed becomes stronger when removing an electron. See the linked question and Philipp's answer within for more detail. (Don't look at the other answers, they are as wrong as they could be.)
In short: The bond order of $\ce{CO}$ is not exactly 3 and removing an electron will not increase the bond order to 3.5. In both cases, the observed bond order is probably closer to 2.5, while experiments suggest that the bond is stronger in $\ce{CO+}$.

An orbital with bonding character has no node perpendicular to the bond axis; an orbital with anti-bonding character has at least one node perpendicular to the bond axis (electron density is zero). Strictly speaking there are no non-bonding orbitals."
Why are Group 11 elements unreactive?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32487/why-are-group-11-elements-unreactive,19k,"The first step toward answering this question is understanding the extent to which the statement ""Group 11 metals are unreactive"" is or isn't true.  
As stated in How do plants respond to copper deficiency? Plant Signaling and Behavior vol. 3, pages 231-232:

The transition metal copper is essential for all organisms.

It is not just that copper is present in every living thing.  Copper is reacting in every living thing. Copper ions cycle between the +1 and +2 oxidation states in Plastocyanin,  Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and cytochrome oxidase. So as you are saying copper is unreactive, it as reacting in cytochrome oxidase in every mitochondrion of your body, and in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase in the cytosol of cells through your body.

Looking at this list, we see that there are a substantial number of d-block metals that are less reactive than copper.  A few are less reactive than silver, and gold is the least reactive on the basis standard reduction potential. 
The overall trend in d-block metals, is down and to the right in the block is less reactive. The exception is that, for a given row, the group 12 metal is more reactive than the group 11 metal, but due to the formation of a 2+ ion, not a 1+ ion.  
Next we should look at ionization energies of d-block metals to see how much of the reduction potential corresponds to properties of an individual atom, versus bulk or solvent effects.   
Looking at first-ionization energies, for each row of the d-block, the highest ionization energy is always the group 12 element (Zn, Cd, Hg). This corresponds well with the fact the Zn, Cd and Hg do not form +1 ions.  The group 11 elements have significantly lower first-ionization energies, and do form +1 ions.  
Then looking at second-ionization energies, group 11 has the highest second-ionization energies for every row of the d-block!
Much of the reactive/unreactivity of d-block is explained by the increase of nuclear charge to the right and down the d-block.  The complete d-shell of neutral group 11 atoms shields the valence s electron well enough that it may be removed to react.  However, to lose 2 electrons, the group 11 elements would need to lose a d-electron from a completed d-shell, which is difficult.  For group 12, two s valance electrons can be lost, and the complete d-shell maintained."

Acidity order of nitrophenols,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/54008/acidity-order-of-nitrophenols,39k,"You have correctly identified that m-nitrophenol should be the weakest acid among the isomers as the resulting anion cannot be stabilised by the $\text{-M}$ effect of nitro group owing to its meta location.
The acidity order of the remaining two nitrophenols can be explained in this way:

Hydrogen bonding is possible in both of them. But note that:

$$\text{H-bonding} \propto \delta^+ \text{charge on $\ce{H}$ atom}$$
Inductive effect (here, $\text{-I}$) is distance dependent. So $\delta^+$ charge on the $\ce{H}$ of ortho-nitrophenol's -$\ce{OH}$ is going to be more than the $\delta^+$ charge the $\ce{H}$ atom of para-nitrophenol's -$\ce{OH}$.

Also,  quoting from this comment:


Usually the $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ of a substance is determined in dilute solution. So just due to dilution, there won't be many/any inter-molecular H bonds, but there can still be plenty of intra-molecular ones.


The answer above the comment relates the strength of these two types of hydrogen bonds to kinetic motion of molecules:


Inter-molecular interaction, such as inter-molecular hydrogen bonding only take place for a short time when two molecules are in each other's vicinity. Shortly after, the molecules separate and the interaction does no longer exist.
Intra-molecular interactions on the other hand are much stronger since the two atoms forming the hydrogen bond remain in each others proximity due to structure of the molecule. In other words, they exhibit strain.

These three factors help us conclude that:

Strength of intra-molecular hydrogen bonding in o-nitrophenol $\gt$ Strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in p-nitrophenol

Thus, p-nitrobenzoic acid is more acidic than the o-isomer.

...and since phenol has no ring activating group, it comes out to be least acidic in the given compounds.

This reasoning is incorrect. Phenol has no group that stabilises the negative charge on the resulting phenoxide ion through $\text{-M}$ or $\text{-I}$ effect (a deactivating group). Therefore, it's the weakest acid of all under investigation."

Why is the magnesium(II) ion preferred over other ions in chlorophyll?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/49308/why-is-the-magnesiumii-ion-preferred-over-other-ions-in-chlorophyll,12k,"Chlorophyll in plants has two main functions. First, it facilitates energy transfer of an absorbed photon's energy via the many other chlorophylls that constitute the antenna pigment-protein complex to the reaction centre. This means that with $> 95~\%$ efficiency the energy of a  single absorbed photon reaches the reaction centre which consists of a dimer of chlorophyll molecules (the special pair), two pheophytins ($\ce{2H}$ replace $\ce{Mg}$) and two other chlorophylls.  The second role is in electron transfer. Electron transfer begins from the excited special pair and the electron is passed to other nearby chlorophyll and pheophytin molecules and then to quinones/iron sulfur complexes depending on the particular type of reaction centre. The exciton interaction between the two chlorophyll in the special pair means that it can be treated as a single entity. This interaction lowers its excited state energy and so traps the energy arriving from the antenna.
It is possible to make chlorophylls with other metals instead of magnesium, but if these contain heavy or paramagnetic ones they will competitively quench the chlorophyll's excited state (via a spin-orbit coupling or 'heavy atom effect') and reform the ground state. Consequently very little if any energy transfer will occur. This means that insufficient energy will reach the reaction centre and so the efficiency of photosynthesis will be dramatically reduced. 
Magnesium chlorophyll has a unique property which is that the absorption and emission spectra overlap exceptionally well meaning that energy transfer to nearby molecules by the Forster (resonance) mechanism is very favourable. As shown in the figure below the energy may move among $\approx 100\ \ce{Chl}$ molecules and reaches the reaction centre in a few ($ < 10\ \mathrm{ps}$) picoseconds. This means that light harvesting antenna have very poor fluorescence yield since most of the absorbed energy reaches the special pair, where is quenched, before a molecule has had a chance to fluoresce because the Chl fluorescence lifetime is $\approx 5\ \mathrm{ns}$. Changing the central metal will change the absorption and emission spectra, most likely in a way to be less effective at energy transfer simply because magnesium chlorophyll has almost the best possible overlap of absorption and emission spectra of any molecules.
The energetics of electron transfer are very delicately balanced. The electron has to move from the excited special pair to the final acceptor (say a quinone) through the steps $\ce{(Chl)_2^* -> Chl -> Phe -> Quinine }$ with as high an efficiency as possible (the whole process takes only $\approx \pu{250ps}$ in bacteria, and ten times faster in plants), but the rate of each back reaction on each step has to be as low as possible. Other metals in Chl will change the redox and even a change of $0.1~\mathrm{V}$ will be important, and so make this process less efficient. The reason for this is that in normal photosynthesis electron transfer is almost at the peak of the Marcus rate vs. free energy curve, thus increasing or decreasing the exothermicity will make the electron transfer less efficient. 
All of this illustrates that photosynthesis is, via natural selection, highly adapted, and so small changes can have dramatic effects. Under different conditions, it may be possible for alternative schemes to do the same job.
The figure shows the antenna (light harvesting) chlorophylls in the protein complex of plant photosystem 1 and the reaction centre. (The protein residues have been removed for clarity). The reaction centre is at the centre, shown within the dotted line with the special pair shown edge on. The final electron acceptors are $\ce{FeS}$ complexes but they are not shown and would lie directly below the special pair. The molecules to either side of the special pair are the accessory chlorophylls through which the electron from the special pair travels.  The structure is modified from PDB entry 1JBO."
Why is manganese(II) coloured although the transition should be spin-forbidden?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/50436/why-is-manganeseii-coloured-although-the-transition-should-be-spin-forbidden,13k,"Selection rules
The intensity of the transition from a state $\mathrm{i}$ to a state $\mathrm{f}$ is governed by the transition dipole moment $\mu_{\mathrm{fi}}$ (strictly, it is proportional to $|\mu_{\mathrm{fi}}|^2$):
$$\iint \Psi_\mathrm{f}^*\hat{\mu}\Psi_\mathrm{i}\,\mathrm{d}\tau \,\mathrm{d}\omega \tag{1}$$
where $\mathrm{d}\tau$ is the usual volume element (representing integration over spatial coordinates) and $\omega$ is an additional spin coordinate (since the states $\Psi$ also specify the spin). For an electronic transition, $\hat{\mu}$ is the electric dipole moment operator, and only depends on the spatial coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$. (I've also ignored the vibrational component i.e. the Franck-Condon factor since it's not really relevant for the purposes of this answer.)
Normally in determining selection rules, we are more interested in whether the integral in $(1)$ is zero or not. If the integral is zero, the transition is said to be forbidden. The usual way to determine whether it is zero is by using symmetry: if the integrand is antisymmetric under any symmetry operation, then the integral is zero. (It is exactly analogous to the integral of an odd function $f(x)$ over a symmetric region; for example, $\int_{-a}^a \sin x \,\mathrm{d}x = 0$.)
If we assume that both the initial and final states can be separated into spin and spatial components, then we get:
$$\iint (\psi_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{spin}\psi_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{space})\hat{\mu}(\psi_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{spin}\psi_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{space})\,\mathrm{d}\tau\,\mathrm{d}\omega$$
(I also dropped the complex conjugates - they aren't important.) Since $\hat{\mu}$ does not operate on the spin coordinate, we can separate this multiple integral:
$$\left(\int \psi_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{spin} \psi_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{spin} \,\mathrm{d}\omega\right) \left(\int \psi_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{space} \hat{\mu} \psi_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{space} \,\mathrm{d}\tau\right)$$
The first integral is nonzero if $\Delta S = 0$. The quantum number $S$ is related to the eigenvalue of a hermitian operator (the actual eigenvalue is $S(S+1)\hbar^2$), and eigenfunctions of a hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are necessarily orthogonal, making the integral identically zero if $\Delta S \neq 0$. This is the spin selection rule.
The second integral is nonzero if $\psi_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{space}$ and $\psi_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{space}$ have a different character under the inversion operation, i.e. one is gerade and another is ungerade. This is because $\hat{\mu}$ itself is ungerade, so for the integrand to be gerade, we need $\psi_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{space}\psi_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{space}$ to be ungerade ($\mathrm{u \otimes u = g}$). In turn this means that $\psi_\mathrm{f}^\mathrm{space}$ and $\psi_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{space}$ must have different symmetry. This is the Laporte selection rule. It can be relaxed when the geometry is not perfectly octahedral, or tetrahedral for that matter, since inversion is no longer a symmetry operation. However, I digress.

Spin-orbit coupling
The problems arise because the total states are not separable into spin and spatial components. This occurs because both electron spin, as well as orbital angular momentum, are both angular momenta. They therefore interact with each other, and this is the spin-orbit coupling spoken of. Mathematically, it is treated as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian; the result is that the transition dipole moment cannot be separated into two integrals and this leads to the invalidation of the selection rules.
When considering spin-orbit coupling, the term symbols such as $^3\!F$, $^1\!D$, which imply a simultaneous eigenstate of the total spin operator $\hat{S}$ and the total orbital angular momentum operator $\hat{L}$ are no longer meaningful since both angular momenta are coupled to each other (by $\vec{j} = \vec{l} + \vec{s}$) and behave as one ""combined"" source of angular momentum. The quantities $S$ and $L$ are called ""nearly good"" quantum numbers: they are no longer strictly conserved, but the ""contamination"" of different quantum numbers is relatively small. Mathematically we could express this as an admixture of different spin states into the original wavefunction:
$$^3\!F_J = c(^3\!F) + c_1(^1\!F) + \cdots$$
where $^3\!F_J$ denotes a state with spin-orbit coupling (not an eigenstate of $\hat{S}$ and $\hat{L}$), and $(^3\!F)$ denotes the original $^3\!F$ state before spin-orbit coupling is considered (which is a true eigenstate of $\hat{S}$ and $\hat{L}$). If $c_i \neq 0$, then one obtains a non-zero transition dipole moment between ""states"" of nominally different $S$.
The fact that the selection rules are still a thing is solely because spin-orbit coupling is a small effect ($c_i$ close to 0), so the compounds behave ""almost"" as if they obey the selection rules. More properly, the transition dipole moment between states of different $S$ is small, and therefore the d-d bands in $\mathrm{d^5}$ spectra are extremely weak. The magnitude of spin-orbit coupling, however, does vary with $Z^4$ ($Z$ being the atomic number). Therefore, while spin-orbit coupling is rather small in the 3d series, it becomes an extremely important mechanism by which the spin selection rule in the the 4d and 5d congeners, as well as the f-block elements, is relaxed."
Is activation energy temperature-independent?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/44327/is-activation-energy-temperature-independent,29k,"There is a simple (some might say simplistic) way to get an intuition about this and it involves thinking at the molecular or atomic level rather than about the bulk properties of the reaction (the thermodynamic view).
For a simple reaction where molecule A has to bang into molecule B to create molecule C, the reaction will only happen if the amount of energy involved in the collision is large enough. The amount of energy involved depends on the nature of the reaction which is determined by the electronic structures of A and B. Within limits, those electronic structures don't vary with temperature and a given reaction will only occur when there is enough energy in the collision for the reaction to happen. 
What changes with temperature isn't the energy required for the reaction to occur, it is the number of molecules that have enough energy to overcome the barrier. At higher temperatures more molecules have that energy, but the amount of energy required doesn't change. The amount of energy require to initiate the reaction is roughly equivalent to the activation energy. It can be calculated by looking at the way the overall rate of the reaction changes with temperature. So the rate of reaction changes with temperature but not the barrier to the reaction happening.
This view is a little simplified but it gives the right intuition about the problem."
What is the difference between an element and an atom?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/36911/what-is-the-difference-between-an-element-and-an-atom,34k,"The wording in your quote is a bit unclear, I agree. A very nice definition is given by the Jefferson Lab page What is the simplest way of explaining what atoms, elements, compounds and mixtures are?
Atoms

are the smallest bits of ordinary matter

Whereas an element is

a substance that is made entirely from one type of atom

Atoms themselves can be 'broken down' into smaller sub-atomic particles (protons, neutrons and electrons) - the amounts of these (particularly the number of protons) define each element.
For example, in their un-ionised form, the element carbon is made entirely from carbon atoms, which have 6 protons and 6 electrons each, and cadmium atoms, which have 48 protons and 48 electrons, make up the element cadmium.
The amount of neutrons can vary with atoms of a particular element, forming isotopes, which (from the link):

For example, carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14 are three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12, 13 and 14 respectively. The atomic number of carbon is 6, which means that every carbon atom has 6 protons, so that the neutron numbers of these isotopes are 6, 7 and 8 respectively.

Different arrangements of atoms of single elements can form allotropes, such as for carbon, with diamond and graphite (among others - shown below). They both are composed of atoms of the element carbon, but in different configurations.
Below are diagrams of the allotropes of carbon featured in the article Work Function Engineering of Graphene (Garg et al. 2014)"
Oxidation state of the sulfur atoms in the thiosulfate Ion,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/24928/oxidation-state-of-the-sulfur-atoms-in-the-thiosulfate-ion,42k,"According to Oxidation state of sulfur in thiosulfate and implications for anaerobic energy metabolism

according to the currently held view, the two sulfur atoms of thiosulfate exist in the oxidation state of sulfate (+6) and sulfide (−2) and do not change their respective oxidation states upon disproportionation. Our results based on XANES spectroscopy indicate that the two different sulfur atoms in thiosulfate have charge densities corresponding to +5 and −1 oxidation states 

and in Using X-ray absorption to probe sulfur oxidation states in complex molecules

the oxidation states were established for the outer and inner sulfur atoms of thiosulfate as −1 and +5, respectively. The revised values give a far better understanding of the role of thiosulfate as an energy substrate for bacteria because intra-molecular electron transfer, which generates metabolic energy with the production of sulfide and sulfate, cannot be envisaged with the previous view that the oxidation states were −2 and +6 for the outer and inner sulfur atoms of thiosulfate

Although both of the above articles are by the same author. 
On the other hand, Determination of Changes in Sulfur Oxidation States
in Prostate Cancer Cells

there is a difference between formal and apparent
  oxidation state received from XANES measurements, for
  example the apparent oxidation states of sulfur in thiosulfates,
  obtained from XANES data, are -1 and +5,
  while the formal ones are -2 and +6. Such a difference
  could occur due to the calibration curve which has been done
  on the basis of chemical compounds in which there are
  ionic bonds which isn't true in the case of thiosulfates.

However, it must be kept in mind that according to the current IUPAC definition, the oxidation state is not an actual property of a substance but instead a charge ""an atom might be imagined to have"", specifically: 

[Oxidation State] is defined as the charge an atom might be imagined to have when electrons are counted according to an agreed-upon set of rules: (l) the oxidation state of a free element (uncombined element) is zero; (2) for a simple (monatomic) ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion; (3) hydrogen has an oxidation state of 1 and oxygen has an oxidation state of -2 when they are present in most compounds. (Exceptions to this are that hydrogen has an oxidation state of -1 in hydrides of active metals, e.g. LiH, and oxygen has an oxidation state of -1 in peroxides, e.g. H2O2); (4) the algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion. 

The current IUPAC definition of oxidation state doesn't specify how to apportion electrons of bonds between two atoms of the same element.  This causes various oxidation states to meet the IUPAC definition depending upon how one chooses to apportion the electrons of the S-S bond between the two S atoms.  Also, experimentally, the S-S is somewhere between a single bond and a double bond based on its length, so the number of electrons to be apportioned is also in question.  One could say the oxidation states are of the S atoms are -2, +6; -1, +5 or 0, +4 without contradicting the IUPAC definition.
In ""Expanded Definition of the Oxidation State"" there is a proposed addition to the definition:

Bonds between like atoms (having the same formal charge) are cleaved homolytically.

If an S=S double bond of thiosulfate is cleaved homolytically, 0 and +4 oxidation states result.
If an S-S single bond of thiosulfate is cleaved homolytically, -1 and +5 oxidation states result.
However, the article concludes 0 and +4 oxidation states even with the single bond, because when there is a single S-S bond the two S-S atoms do not have the same formal charge. They give both electrons from the S-S single bond to the central S. Below is Fig. 4 from the article:

The most recent (June 2014) information (and probably most authoritative) I can find is Toward a comprehensive definition of oxidation state (IUPAC Technical Report) Pure and Applied Chemistry. Volume 86, Pages 1017–1081
In this article, another definition of Oxidation State is proposed requiring 

Bonds between two atoms of the same element are divided equally.

with no exceptions for formal charges.  This clearly rules out the possibility of -2, +6 oxidation states for the S atoms in thiosulfate, but leaves ambiguity between-1, +5
 if the S-S bond is single and 0, +4 if the S=S bond is double.  
Specifically, concerning thiosulfate the article states:

Structural properties of sodium thiosulfate suggest that all its terminal atoms carry some of the anion
  charge. In other words, all form ionocovalent bonds to a cation. The calculated Mulliken charges (−1.4 for
  O and −1.1 for terminal S) confirm this but, being different, they suggest unequal SS and SO bond orders. The
  SS bond distance of 2.025 Å (202.5 pm) is shorter than the single bond of 2.055 Å (205.5 pm) in crystalline
  $\ce{S8}$ or 2.056 Å (205.6 pm) in the $\ce{H_2S_2}$ gas, but substantially longer than the double bond of 1.883 Å
  (188.3 pm) in $\ce{S2O}$ or 1.889 Å (188.9 pm) in $\ce{S2}$. Given this uncertain situation, the approach chosen
  here is to draw in Fig. 24 two limiting Lewis formulas. 

Then they proceed to draw two Lewis formulas, similar to above, one on the left with S-S single bond and -1 and +5 oxidation states for the sulfurs and one on the right with S=S double bond and 0 and +4 oxidation states for the sulfurs, and go on to say:

The result in Fig. 24 means that the individual OS of the two sulfur atoms in thiosulfate are ambiguous,
  and no formula in-between these two limits yields reasonable values. The formula on left provides an
  unusual yet not entirely illogical OS of −1 for the terminal sulfur, reminiscent of the oxygen OS in peroxides.
  The formula on right, while having an SS bond order that is too high, suggests OS values that at times
  are used...

The article also comments that:

A nominal OS is one that has been nominally adjusted against the generic OS definition in order to suit a specific purpose. That purpose may be...polarizing
  a homonuclear bond in thiosulfate to OS [of S] = +6 and −2 in order to emphasize the uniqueness of the central atom and similarity of all four ligands."
Hottest region of Bunsen flame,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/93844/hottest-region-of-bunsen-flame,28k,"The question itself is poorly written as given.
The diagram should have ""regions"" and ""points."" 

So what seems to be labeled ""Region 2"" and ""Region 4"" I would name as ""Point 2"" and  ""Point 3"" respectively. 
So the innermost conical area would be ""Region 1"", the next conical area would be ""Region 2"" and the third conical area would be ""Region 3.""
Region 1 is where the mostly unburned gas and oxygen mixture are pushing above the lip of the Bunsen Burner. Region 1 exists because the gas coming out of the tube is cool. If the air port is open and the gas flow is too low then the gas will start to burn down the tube and you'll get a ""strike back"" where the flame is either (1) blown out or (2) burns at the jet. If the gas flow is too great you can blow the burning region off contact with the upper tube. If you increase the gas flow even more then you can in fact blow the flame out.
Region 2 would be a reducing region within the flame. This region is hot and burns the fuel and oxygen coming out of the tube. 
Region 3 would be a oxidizing region of the flame. Here oxygen from ""outside air"" (oxygen which didn't come up the tube) is migrating into the flame to burn the excess fuel which is not bunt in region 2. 
You'd use the reducing and oxidizing regions when doing bead tests for identification.  
Point 2 would be the hottest part of the flame as shown by the composite image of a paperclip in the flame from the YouTube video."

Why are equilibrium constants unitless?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/why-are-equilibrium-constants-unitless,27k,"This source explains it well. It looks like part of class material, but it clearly explains the dimensionlessness of $K_{eq}$.

The resolution of this apparent paradox is that the above equation, while perfectly satisfactory for everyday use, is not technically correct.  A more correct version is:
$$K_{eq} = \frac{\frac{\lvert B \rvert_{eq}}{\lvert B \rvert_{ss}} \frac{\lvert C \rvert_{eq}}{\lvert C \rvert_{ss}}}{\frac{\lvert A\rvert_{eq}}{\lvert A\rvert_{ss}}}$$

It then goes on to state:

Strictly speaking, division by the standard state concentrations is also necessary in every thermodynamics equation in which you take the log of a concentration product, otherwise the units don’t come out right.)

A monocyclic 6 carbon ring with 6 double bonds,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33497/a-monocyclic-6-carbon-ring-with-6-double-bonds,12k,"There are several monocyclic $\ce{C6}$ isomers.  Three of them are pictured below


A - the compound you've drawn above, cyclohexahexaene
B - cyclohexatriyne
C - cyclohexa-2,5-diyne-bis-1,4-ylidene

While all of the carbons in these molecules are (more or less) $\ce{sp}$ hybridized, the molecules are different from one another due to differences in bond lengths and bond angles.  For example, all of the bonds in A are exactly the same length due to symmetry, whereas the triple bonds in B will be shorter than the adjacent single bonds.  Therefore, A-C are isomers, not resonance structures.
Ideally the atoms attached to an $\ce{sp}$ hybridized carbon form a linear arrangement (180° bond angle) with the central $\ce{sp}$ carbon, acetylene and the central carbon in allene serve as examples.

(image source)

(image source)
However in the cyclic $\ce{C6}$ compounds A-C, the $\ce{sp}$ hybridized carbons are forced by the ring to deviate from the desired 180° arrangement to something down around 120°.  Therefore, quite a bit of angle strain is incorporated into A-C making them extremely strained and unavailable through laboratory preparation to date.
As mentioned above, A-C have different bond lengths and bond angles therefore they are isomers, not resonance structures.  A fascinating question is, 

Do A-C each sit in a potential well, separated from one another by an energy barrier and if so, which one is the most stable (energy minimum)?

or 

Is there another monocyclic species lower in energy than A-C? Perhaps a molecule that could be described by resonance structures A'-C', where the prime denotes that all of the bond lengths and angles have been adjusted and made equal in A, B and C."
Which carbons in pyrrole have the highest electron density?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/64418/which-carbons-in-pyrrole-have-the-highest-electron-density,13k,"Interesting question, more subtle than I realized! 
Theoretical approach: I would turn to resonance and induction as the rationale for electronic properties. I think all of your resonance forms may contribute about equally to the resonance hybrid. This suggests that all four carbons would share roughly the same amount of electron density. However, we must also consider the inductive effect of the nitrogen atom, which draws some electron density away from C2 and C5 through the sigma bonds. This would imply that the two proximal carbons (closest to N) are more electron-deficient, and the distal (more distant) pair of carbons are more electron-rich.
Experimental considerations: Orthocresol has a good point that pyrroles are observed to form bonds with electrophiles at the proximal carbons (2/5). However, I think this trend may be due to the superior stability of the intermediate produced by that pathway (3 significant resonance forms) versus a distal (3/4) attack (2 significant forms). The cation from a proximal attack is better stabilized by resonance than the distal-attack cation. I expect that pyrrole forming C2 bonds with electrophiles has more to do with the stability of the intermediate of that pathway than necessarily greater electron density on C2. What I did not expect, but read on Wikipedia, is this: 

Unlike furan and thiophene, [pyrrole] has a dipole in which the positive end lies on the side of the heteroatom, with a dipole moment of $1.58\ \mathrm{D}$.

This is experimental evidence demonstrating that the electron density is lower on the proximal side (C2,5) and greater on the distal side (C3,4). Besides molecular modeling of the electron density clouds, I think the molecular dipole moment is about the most conclusive evidence one can hope for.
It really comes down to the context: in an undergrad first-semester course, you might be expected to say the distal carbons have more density because the nitrogen withdraws from the proximal carbons. In more advanced courses, you might take orthocresol's perspective and base your answer in reactivity, concluding the proximal have more electron density. But I expect a doctorate researcher would probably conduct molecular modeling and compute the electron distributions using quantum mechanics, and perhaps conduct a few experiments to measure the dipole. And at that level, I think C3 and C4 have the honey."
Why formulate drugs as HCl salts when HCl is in stomach acid?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/20309/why-formulate-drugs-as-hcl-salts-when-hcl-is-in-stomach-acid,21k,"Another reason is that many drugs which are conjugated to hydrochloride salts is they are amines, and amines by themselves often stink. So people might be turned off from taking drugs that smell terrible (fishy). 
Now, note that even though a label might say something such as ""fexofenadine HCl"" that doesn't mean there is HCl in the drug. Fexofenadine is an amine, and amines are somewhat basic - and more than basic enough for a strong acid such as HCl to completely protonate. 
So if this is what you had in mind for the structure of fexofenadine, it isn't the most correct structure:

This would be a much better structure. The nitrogen in the ring has been protonated and it now bears a positive formal charge. Chloride ion is the counter ion."

This reproduces the gPeriodic data, warts and all. I make no guarantees regarding its correctness, recency, etc. I just munged the data.
Some of the data is augmented with tildes, notes about temperature/polymorph/state etc. I've left these as they are but you may need to trim them if you want to plot them as numeric values.
Argon had an atomic radius of '2-', whatever that means. I cut it.
Excel is joke software and habitually interprets numbers wrapped in parentheses as negatives, because apparently some accountants decided that surrounding numbers in parens is a more sensible option than using a minus sign. Needless to say, this is wrong. I've addressed the problem by wrapping the affected numbers in angle brackets.
There are no ionic radii in the source data. At all. Not my fault.
The columns inherit the units of the source data. I've left the units out on purpose because I wanted each column to have no spaces in the name for ease of processing in R or whatever. Furthermore, the units in the source file have some inconvenient characters from an encoding perspective.

What causes the really bad smell of rotten potatoes?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/24035/what-causes-the-really-bad-smell-of-rotten-potatoes,84k,"My first guess was that it was putrescine and other polyamines---but the smell of putrefying potatoes actually comes from methyl mercaptan,  dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide. Check it:

Source: A. Kamiya, Y. Ose, Study on offensive odor (Report IV): A Consideration of Putrefaction and Offensive Odor of Solid Waste, Journal of Japan Society of Air Pollution, 18(5), 1983, pp  453-463.
Notice that the headspace composition changes quite a bit with time. Most of the headspace chromatography studies I found dealt with early detection of disease organisms in infected potatoes, rather than potatoes in full putrefaction mode. You'll also find many references to solanine poisoning from potatoes; solanine is a toxic glycoalkaloid, is nonvolatile, and has nothing at all to do with the foul smell and toxic gas produced by putrid potatoes.
Methyl mercaptan ($\rm CH_3SH$) has an odor described as ""rotting cabbage"" by ATDSR; it's one of the major contributors to the smell of farts (oh, sorry, ""flatus"" if we're being polite). It has an odor detection threshold as low as 1 ppb. 
Dimethyl sulfide ($\rm (CH_3)_2S$) is responsible for the smell of the sea (in low concentrations); it too has a cabbagy smell. 
Dimethyl trisulfide ($\rm CH_3SSSCH_3$) is present in relatively smaller amounts but it has an even stronger odor. The detection threshold is around 1 part per trillion, and it is apparently a strong insect attractant. 
The gases produced by rotting potatoes are quite toxic (see Rotting potatoes in basement kill four members of Russian family).  
(To keep the notes below in context, in my original answer I said that a plot point in ""The Walking Dead"" was that zombies couldn't smell delicious humans if they were wearing coats smeared with rotting flesh. I suggested that when the zombie apocalypse arrives, packing your pockets with putrid potatoes might work, too. Now I'm not so sure. Can zombies distinguish between polyamines and sulfur compounds? Perhaps they're stench connoisseurs.)"
Why does solubility of solids sometimes decrease with temperature increase?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/31020/why-does-solubility-of-solids-sometimes-decrease-with-temperature-increase,28k,"In short, for this group 2 hydroxide crystal, the dissolution and solvation process is an exothermic equilibrium. Increasing the temperature drives the reaction in the reverse, favouring crystallisation! 
However, it would be nice to rationalise some of these terms, so I will lay out a very brief overview of general solubility factors so you can understand the process in a little more detail. 
Solubility is a complex thermodynamic process that takes many factors into account. It can be understood as the process of dissolving a crystal in a solvent, and then forming a solvent cage around the solute (solvation). It is a function of three interactions at heart;

solute-solute
solute-solvent 
solvent-solvent 

Large solute-solute interactions hinder solubility and are associated with high lattice enthalpies (of crystalline solutes), these must be overcome in order to break up the solid and dissolve it. Solvent-solvent interactions must also be overcome in order to solvate the dissolved solute, therefore for a highly interacting solvent the solubility is reduced. 
The formation of ordered solvent structures such as clathrin cages etc orders the solvent, and therefore reduces solvent entropy significantly. Therefore solvents with high degrees of freedom hinder solubility. 
Solute entropy favours solvation, this reflects the higher solubility of flexible molecules, this is because in the solid they are all locked up, while in solution their rotational and vibrational modes are populated. 
In addition to these if the solute has multiple ionic forms then the solubility will be a function of pH too, so must be held constant in practice. The surface profile of the solid too, as well as the extent of cavitation and porosity are also key factors (since they affect the number of solvent-solute interactions possible). 
Importantly the type of solvent into which you are trying to dissolve your crystal in is also of fundamental importance! The rule ""like dissolves like"" is best understood by the (semi-empirical) general solubility equation, 
\begin{equation}
\log S =\frac 12-0.05 (T_m-T)-\log P
\end{equation}
A large partition coefficient (the ratio of how soluble the crystal is in organic solvent to aqueous solvent) reduces the solubility, (and mathematically since $\log x$ follows $x$ in limits). 
To further complicate the situation there are several definitions of solubility that we can take. In practice we choose intrinsic aqueous solubility, mainly used for high throughput and speed in drug development.
Solubility is really an experimentalists tool for parametrising the extent of Gibbs energy for the dissolving-solvation process, which in turn is usually modelled by complex thermodynamic cycles via gas phase species or super cooled liquids. Modern research into solubility focuses on finding either molecular descriptors through random forest/QSPR or support vector models etc (which are all just number crunching techniques to find correlations between large sets of data) or through fundamental physics and chemistry of the process. 
\begin{equation}
\log S=\frac{(-\Delta G_{sol}/RT)}{\ln 10}
\end{equation}
So we understand solubility as an equilibrium constant for the Gibbs change of the solvation process (whatever particular cycle you use to get that data). 
Now that we know something about solubility we can ask ourselves, under what conditions does increasing the temperature reduce solubility? 
In practice the temperature can effect the entropic term, but also the enthalpies of the crystal lattices, the heats given out by the solute-solvent interactions etc. It is the balance of these process that determines the solubility of something.  
In your case we are observing a calcium hydroxide crystal dissolve in aqueous solvent. As we increase the temperature the solubility decreases. There is an equilibrium between crystallisation and (dissolution + solvation). Increasing the temperature is shifting that equilibrium to favour the crystallisation rather than (as we crudely expect) in the forward. This is simply an enthalpic term, due to the solvation process being an exothermic process, increasing the temperature drives the equilibrium in the reverse by Le Chatlier's principle.  
Hope that is a bit clearer, and that you now understand some of the ideas behind solubility. :)"
Is KF the most ionic compound?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/17064/is-kf-the-most-ionic-compound,18k,"Yes, this is a subtle thing.
Using the Pauling electronegativities, one would expect CsF to have the larger electronegativity difference (3.2). So in principal, it should be ""more ionic.""
Unfortunately, an ionic bond requires separating charge, so $\ce{Cs+F-}$. The problem is that $\ce{Cs+}$ is much larger than $\ce{K+}$ and so the dipole moment for a fully ionic $\ce{Cs+F-}$ would be much larger.
We find that the charge isn't fully separated, likely because of the need to stabilize the large dipole moment.
So some people plot a curve of ""% ionic character"" as determined by the actual dipole moment vs. the expected dipole moment (i.e, full charge separation). We find that this curve reaches a limit ~75-85% ionic character.
IIRC, I think on that basis LiF is more Ionic than KF.

Why isn't the orbital angular momentum also considered while calculating the magnetic moments 3d transition elements?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/60970/why-isnt-the-orbital-angular-momentum-also-considered-while-calculating-the-mag,13k,"Simplistically speaking orbital angular momentum is present when some conditions are satisfied:

A set of orbitals are degenerate;
These orbitals can be ""interconverted"" by rotation about a certain axis;
The set of orbitals is not empty, half-filled, or fully filled.

Physically speaking, the ""rotation"" of an electron from one orbital to the next generates orbital angular momentum. The rotation must not have an energy cost, which necessitates degeneracy. It also means that the set of orbitals must have at least one electron, as well as one empty space (a so-called hole) for the electron to ""rotate"" into. The hole must have the same spin as the electron, which means that a half-filled subshell doesn't allow for orbital angular momentum (since all the electrons have parallel spins).
This is most easily illustrated with the three 2p orbitals in an atom. Rotation of a $\mathrm{p}_x$ orbital by 90 degrees around the $y$-axis, for example, turns it into a $\mathrm{p}_z$ orbital.
Any atom with a $\mathrm{p}^1$, $\mathrm{p}^2$, $\mathrm{p}^4$, or $\mathrm{p}^5$ configuration therefore possesses nonzero angular momentum. This is also reflected in their term symbols where $L = 1$. This is said to be ""one unit of angular momentum"". An atom with a half-filled shell (for example, $\ce{N}$)  or a closed-shell $\mathrm{p}^6$ configuration (for example, $\ce{Ne}$) does not have any orbital angular momentum.
The five 3d orbitals in an atom also satisfy these requirements. It is less intuitive to see this as compared to the 2p orbitals, because we have taken specific linear combinations of the complex 3d orbitals and converted them into real orbitals. Nevertheless one can use quantum mechanics to prove that the 3d orbitals possess angular momentum. The maths can be found in Figgis and Hitchman's Ligand Field Theory and Its Applications (it is very early in the book, but I do not have it with me now and cannot remember offhand where it is). As such, for free 3d metal atoms or ions, the orbital angular momentum has to be incorporated into the calculation of the magnetic moment. Exceptions are, of course, $\mathrm{d^0}$, $\mathrm{d^5}$, and $\mathrm{d^{10}}$ ions (e.g. $\ce{Sc^3+}$, $\ce{Mn^2+}$, and $\ce{Zn^2+}$).

That is applicable for free ions. However, 3d metals do not commonly exist as free ions, but exist in coordination complexes with a ligand field. For simplicity we'll consider a perfect octahedral ligand field, which causes d orbitals to split into a $\mathrm{t_{2g}}$ ($\mathrm{d}_{xy}$, $\mathrm{d}_{xz}$, $\mathrm{d}_{yz}$) and $\mathrm{e_{g}}$ ($\mathrm{d}_{z^2}$, $\mathrm{d}_{x^2-y^2}$) set. This means that the five d orbitals are no longer all degenerate, breaking the first condition stipulated above.
At a simplistic level, many textbooks will claim that this leads to a ""quenching"" of orbital angular momentum, which just means that there is no longer any orbital angular momentum, and as such, the spin-only formula applies. [Note that there are some second-order effects (quantum mechanical mixing of excited states into the ground state) that can lead to deviations from the spin-only formula.]
This is true to a certain extent. However, the five 3d orbitals are not split into individually nondegenerate orbitals; the three $\mathrm{t_{2g}}$ orbitals, for example, are still degenerate. On top of that, one can verify pictorially that it is possible to rotate the $\mathrm{t_{2g}}$ orbitals into one another. In this aspect the $\mathrm{t_{2g}}$ orbitals behave quite similarly to the three $\mathrm{p}$ orbitals in a free atom; this is called the ""$\mathrm{t_2}$-$\mathrm{p}$ isomorphism"". As such, the $\mathrm{t_{2g}}$ orbitals still have orbital angular momentum associated with them.
Any complex with unsymmetrical occupancy of the $\mathrm{t_{2g}}$ orbitals (i.e. $\mathrm{t_{2g}}^1$, $\mathrm{t_{2g}}^2$, $\mathrm{t_{2g}}^4$, $\mathrm{t_{2g}}^5$) therefore possesses orbital angular momentum and exhibit great deviations from the spin-only formula. These complexes all have a $\mathrm{T_{1g}}$ or $\mathrm{T_{2g}}$ ground state term symbol, so it is commonly said that ""$\mathrm{T}$ terms possess one unit of orbital angular momentum"". Spin-orbit coupling has to be invoked to obtain a better agreement between the calculated and measured magnetic moments.
As an example of how large the deviations can be, consider the compound $\ce{(NH4)2Co(SO4)2.2H2O}$. This features octahedral Co(II) which adopts a high-spin configuration $(\mathrm{t_{2g}})^5(\mathrm{e_g})^2$. From the spin-only formula, we would expect $\mu_\mathrm{so} = \sqrt{3(3+2} = 3.87$. However, the unsymmetrical population of the $\mathrm{t_{2g}}$ orbitals leads to the generation of orbital angular momentum, and at $300~\mathrm{K}$ the measured effective magnetic moment is actually $5.1$. (Data from here.)

A more detailed discussion can be found in any of the standard inorganic chemistry textbooks. Figgis and Hitchman's book (mentioned earlier) is more advanced and has a very comprehensive treatment of the subject."
Does the number of H+ ions in solution go up on dilution of a weak acid?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/7648/does-the-number-of-h-ions-in-solution-go-up-on-dilution-of-a-weak-acid,16k,"Let's say we have got a solution of an acid with a pK$_a=5$.

One can see that low acid concentrations lead to higher pH values than higher acid concentrations which automatically result in an increasing degree of dissociation.
So for me this is no big intuition thing but rather a small sequence of actions.

Lets say it in math:
The proton concentration for your system can be described by $$c(\ce{H3O+}) = \sqrt{c_0(\ce{HA})~k_a+k_W}$$ (adding $k_W$ for very low concentrations) and the equation for the degree of dissociation is $$\alpha = \frac{k_a}{k_a+c(\ce{H3O+})}$$ which can be combined to give $$\alpha\left(c_0(\ce{HA})\right)=\frac{k_a}{k_a+\sqrt{c_0(\ce{HA})~k_a+k_W}}$$

One could expand this system a little more (using the exact pH equation including the self-ionization of water) and come up with a thorough scheme like the following.

Why do atoms need 8 electrons to stabilize? [duplicate],https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/54500/why-do-atoms-need-8-electrons-to-stabilize,29k,"The valence orbitals of atoms are composed of suborbitals (s and p)  there is 1 s suborbital which is spherical and can hold 2 electrons (one with up spin and one with down spin). There are 3 p suborbitals which are dumbbell shaped (look like two balloons tied together at the ends) and align along the x,y&z axies and hold a total of 6 electrons (2 per axis, 3 with up spin and 3 with down spin).  Since an atom is energetically satisfied when all of the electrons are paired and 2+6 = 8, an atom must have 8 electrons in its valence shell to pair all of the electrons.
The octet rule does not apply to all atoms though, for transition metals and later elements there is a d suborbital which can hold an addition 10 electrons, meaning that now an atom may have 18 electrons in its valence shell to be satisfied.  This allows for materials such as metal complexes and the sulfate poly-atomic-ion to exist despite having more than eight electrons in the valence shell."
"If capsaicin is insoluble in water, what makes chilli water taste spicy?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/66318/if-capsaicin-is-insoluble-in-water-what-makes-chilli-water-taste-spicy,15k,"You got me curious, so I poked around a bit on this. 
First there is insoluble and then there is insoluble. The Wikipedia article on capsaicin lists its solubility as $\pu{0.0013 g}/\pu{100 mL}$ which is $13$ parts per million. So capsaicin is ""relatively insoluble"", but not wholly so. Second the Wikipedia article also points out that capsaicin itself is just one of the various capsaicinoid chemicals which give peppers their ""hot"" taste.  
At the end of the (old) Wikipedia article on the Scoville scale, a taste test for hotness, it states 

[...] A measurement of one part capsaicin per million corresponds to about 16 Scoville units. [...] 

So, 13 pmm multiplied by 16 Scoville units per ppm is about 200 Scoville units. 
A table on hot sauces and peppers lists the Original TABASCO® brand Pepper Sauce from McIlhenny Company as being 2,500 to 5,000 Scoville units. So 200 Scoville units would be about one tenth strength sauce. That should still be enough to tingle your tongue."
What makes oceanic desalination so expensive?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34188/what-makes-oceanic-desalination-so-expensive,15k,"Reason is salt dissolve very easily with water, forming very strong bond. Not only salt there are also other minerals. To break this bond we need technology as well as energy and both of them are very expensive(today). 
There are two methods by which we can break this bond:

Thermal distillation:
Thermal distillation involves heat: Boiling water turns it into vapor—leaving the salt behind—that is collected and condensed back into water by cooling it down
Membrane distillation: The most common type of membrane separation is called reverse osmosis. Seawater is forced through a semipermeable membrane that separates salt from water. Because the technology typically requires less energy than thermal distillation, most new plants, now use reverse osmosis.

Today about 10 to 13 billion gallon  water are desalinated worldwide per day. That's only about 0.2% of global water consumption.
Membrane distillation is bit more cheaper than thermal distillation. Even though  large amounts of energy are needed to generate the high pressure that forces the water through the filter. Current methods require about 14 kilowatt-hours of energy to produce 1,000 gallons of desalinated seawater.
So we can conclude that cost of distillation is high because we need notable large amount of electricity to heat water in thermal plant and generate high pressure. Also other technology(like say burner, pumps, etc) are also expensive.

Also note we are trying to decrease the cost of distillation and day by day number of seawater distillation  are increasing."
"Painting metal, does it matter if all rust is removed before?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/19322/painting-metal-does-it-matter-if-all-rust-is-removed-before,77k,"How exactly is the water broken down into hydrogen and oxygen?

As the acid is formed and the iron dissolved, some of the water will begin to break down into its component pieces -- hydrogen and oxygen.


That's extreme oversimplification. The reaction common for active metals (not including iron) is
$$\ce{Mg + 2 H2O ->  Mg(OH)2 + H2 ^ }$$
Iron does not react this way. However, it does react with acids, say, with hydrochloric acids
$$\ce{Fe + 2 HCl(aq) -> FeCl2(aq) + H2 ^}$$
The reaction is quite slow even for concentrated nonoxidizing acids. However, in presence of oxygen and in diluted acids two subsequent reactions occur, the one noted above is followed by
$$\ce{4FeCl2 + 10H2O + O2 = 4Fe(OH)3 v + 8HCl }$$
The second reaction effectively removes iron from solution, significantly fastening the overall reaction.  However, even without acid present, even in slightly basic conditions iron slowly reacts with water in presence of free oxygen, forming rust. The process is hindered only at pH above 10 or at absence of free oxygen. Since natural water is usually slightly acidic due to presence of dissolved carbon dioxide, iron always rust on contact with water and atmosphere. This, actually, is a reason why concrete layer over steel frame is regulated: concrete always contains water, and surface layers quickly looses basicity due to reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, so steel near surface of concrete quickly rusts, increasing in volume and tearing the concrete from inside.

In the context of automobile repair work, assume a metal surface has
rust over it. Does it matter if all of the rust is removed before the
metal surface is painted? If it does matter, then why?

Yes, it does. Rust is weak, so any paint over it will hold weak. As long as the paint film over rusty part is broken, water and atmosphere contacts the metal and start to erode it, resulting in more paint film be destroyed. So it is critical to remove all rust from the surface being painted. Abrasive blasting, if you have the equipment, is probably the best way. While some paints may be applied over rust, it should be a very thin layer, and even then I would prefer traditional paint over cleaned surface anyway."
Why is beryllium transparent to x-rays?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/24486/why-is-beryllium-transparent-to-x-rays,12k,"The amount of X-rays absorbed by an element depends on the size of its atoms (its absorption cross-section, specifically, as affected by the size of core orbitals that contain electrons that can be excited by X-ray absorption, and the number of electrons in those orbitals) and how many atoms are packed into a given volume. Big atoms that are close together can absorb more X-rays than small atoms that are far apart.
Beryllium has very small atoms (it has a very small electronic core, with only two electrons in it), and very low density, so it will absorb relatively few X-rays compared to other materials.
According to this page, 37 % of X-rays with a wavelength of 0.56 nm will be absorbed by beryllium window that is 23.5 mm thick. If the window were made of aluminum, it would only have to be 1.4 mm thick to absorb the same amount of X-rays, and if it were made of lead it would only have to be 13 μm thick."
Addition of HOBr across C=C,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/42599/addition-of-hobr-across-c-c,16k,"The 'expected' product comes from analogy of addition of strong acids like HBr or acid (often sulfuric acid) catalyzed hydration. However, The pKa of HOBr is 8.7 (ref), much lower than those conditions, so it's not reasonable to make that analogy. Put another way, the base in those reactions is an alkene, which is very weak. Only a very strong acid will protonate an alkene.
In some quick SciFinder searching, I haven't found any overwhelmingly convincing evidence for the regioselectivity observed in the product, but it does seem reasonable to me by a mechanism similar to what Aditya Dev suggests.

I look at HOBr as an oxygen with a leaving group (analogous to Br-Br). Attack by the alkene on the oxygen releases bromide and gives the tertiary carbocation. Kick back by the oxygen closes a protonated epoxide, which is analogous to the bromonium. In the bromonium case, these are considered resonance structures. I don't know if that's definitely the case here (oxygen is much smaller than bromine), but I've written it that way to continue the analogy. In any case, protonated epoxides are typically attacked at the site best able to stabilize positive charge, which is the tertiary carbon. The resulting bromohydrin is the 'observed' product."
Ipso substitution and its rules,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/91781/ipso-substitution-and-its-rules,11k,"The shorthand way that we draw structures in organic chemistry, with implicit hydrogens, leads us to often forget that the hydrogens are there, or to neglect considering them in our analyses. In electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, the generally accepted mechanism involves attack of the aromatic ring on the electrophile to give a Wheland intermediate, which then loses a proton from the $\mathrm{sp^3}$-hybridized ring carbon to restore aromaticity. Ipso substitution, then, is really nothing special - we simply substitute a position on the aromatic ring that bears a non-hydrogen (e.g., $\ce{X}$) group, presumably via an analogous mechanism. For this to be viable, both steps of the mechanism need to be favorable:

$\ce{X}$ needs to enhance, or at least not greatly reduce, the nucleophilicity of the carbon it is attached to. For example, inductive effects would great disfavor ipso attack at groups like $\ce{F}$ or $\ce{CF3}$.
$\ce{X+}$ should be a reasonable species to lose in the second step, to regain aromaticity, or there should be some mechanism by which $\ce{X}$ can be lost, with electrons flowing back towards the aromatic ring.

Sulfonic acids and carboxylic acids are rather electron-withdrawing, but if you drill down into the details of these ipso-substitution reactions, many are actually conducted on the conjugate base (i.e. sulfonate or carboxylate), which also provides a pathway for loss of a neutral group in the second step, i.e. $\ce{SO3}$ or $\ce{CO2}$. Alternatively, harsh conditions are used, e.g., sulfonation/desulfonation.
It turns out that ipso attack is more common than it first appears, because the product of the initial ipso attack can re-arrange. So, for example, nitration of p-cresol involves 40% attack at the ipso carbon bearing the methyl group, followed by acid-catalyzed rearrangement to the expected product.[1] There is more discussion here.
Closer to the original thrust of your question - there are some groups that are even better at being substituted in an EAS reaction than a proton. Trialkylsilyl and trialkylstannyl groups are often used. Both $\ce{Si}$ and $\ce{Sn}$ are less electronegative than carbon and highly polarizable, making the ipso carbon a good nucleophile. These groups also help to stabilize the Wheland intermediate through hyperconjugation. Finally, they both have energetically-favorable pathways to leave with electron density flowing back towards the aromatic ring. For these reasons, ipso substitution at $\ce{SiR3}$ or $\ce{SnR3}$ substituted carbons can often be achieved rapidly, under mild conditions, with high regioselectivity. This is often helpful in specialist applications, like radiolabelling.
I haven't specifically addressed each of the original three numbered questions, but they can be tackled using the principles above. Ipso substitution is possible for any group - it's a competition, $\ce{H}$ vs $\ce{X}$. Is ipso substitution affected by reaction conditions? I'm sure it could be - factors like protonation states, hard vs soft electrophiles, reversibility, etc. would have an influence."
Why is gum so sticky and what chemicals make for easy removal of gum?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33691/why-is-gum-so-sticky-and-what-chemicals-make-for-easy-removal-of-gum,11k,"The International Chewing Gum Association tells us:

Gum base is what gives chewing gum its “chew.” It is made of a combination of food-grade polymers, waxes, and softeners that give it the texture desired by consumers and enable it to effectively deliver sweetness, flavor, and various other benefits, including dental benefits.

A more complete description of what makes chewing gum sticky states:

Terence Cosgrove, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Bristol and Chief Scientific Officer of Revolymer, explains that the chemical bonds between the molecules in a polymer-based chewing gum make it difficult to remove from a surface. When you pull a piece of used gum off a surface, most of the energy goes into stretching the polymer bonds in the gum, rather than actually breaking the bonds between the surface and the gum. Since polymers are long chains of covalently bonded molecules that give the gum its elasticity and ""chewiness,"" the attractive forces between the atoms are formed by the sharing of electrons [8]. Thus, the bonds between the repeating units tend to remain intact as they lengthen and contract from an applied external force.
The temperature at which the polymer base is exposed to the air also affects both the elasticity and adhesiveness of the chewing gum. When a piece of gum is heated by saliva and deformed by the grinding of human teeth, its polymer chains align in the direction of these forces. The degree of alignment is a function of the magnitude of applied stress, which explains why the gum becomes tougher and less elastic the longer or more rigorously you chew [8]. After the gum is removed from your mouth and placed in a cooler environment, the drop in temperature causes the orientation of the polymer chain to freeze, resulting in a hardened piece of used gum.
Most commercial polymer gum bases are hydrophobic (water-insoluble), which is the reason they stick easily to oily surfaces and are difficult to remove, even with the help of household cleaning solutions. A hydrophobic substance tends to repel polarized molecules like water and attract non-polar compounds, such as the grease and grime on streets. A hydrophilic substance, on the other hand, behaves in the opposite manner by attracting water and repelling fats and oils [8]. A compound that exhibits both hydrophobic and hydrophilic traits is known as ""amphiphilic"" [9]. These substances, which attract both water and oil to some degree, can be used to create synthetic polymers that could help eliminate the sticky mess of chewing gum pollution.

Note: The numbered references in the above block quote can be pulled from the linked article. The article also details efforts aimed at producing a new type of chewing gum that doesn't stick to things as much as normal/currently-manufactured ones seem to. It's a good read.
But to your main point, I've linked the MSDS for a popular product for removing gum and related compounds (it's called Goof Off), which consists almost entirely of acetone (also commonly found in nail polish remover). Given the deleterious health effects of acetone (and its high vapor pressure), it's not a good candidate for your needs.
Something non-stick and more permanent, such as a Teflon spray might be ideal for your needs."

Strength of hydrogen bonding in phenol or methanol,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32164/strength-of-hydrogen-bonding-in-phenol-or-methanol,10k,"Let me answer the second question first, because the answer is so much easier: Of course the hydrogen bond strength depends among others upon the carbon oxygen is attached to. Consider phenol and methanol or methanol and formic acid.
The guess as to which hydrogen bond is stronger is — I have to admit it — my speculation. But I think that methanol should be able to undergo stronger hydrogen bonding.
Phenol, of course, is aromatic and capable of delocalising negative (or positive) charges across its entire ring system — the reason why its $\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}} = 10$, a good five units lower than methanol’s. That means that at the same pH value of the solution, there should be less strong a negative charge on phenol’s oxygen than on methanol’s.
But hydrogen bonds are, to a certain extent, electrostatic interaction. So the system which has a stronger negative charge on the oxygen (methanol) should be able to build up stronger hydrogen bonds by attracting hydrogen more strongly.
One could also picture it differently: Phenol gets deprotonated at a lower pH, so the $\ce{O-H}$-bond must be a lot weaker than methanol’s. But if the $\ce{O-H}$-bond is weak, the oxygen has a larger tendency to simply loose the hydrogen to another electronegative partner (deprotonation/protonation) rather than share it (hydrogen bond)."
"What is the difference between ""vapour"" and ""gas""?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/150235/what-is-the-difference-between-vapour-and-gas,14k,"Vapor is a much older word alluding to dampness and it was not coined by scientists. It is in use since the 1300s. The actual meaning of meaning of vapor is ""Matter in the form of a steamy or imperceptible exhalation; esp. the form into which liquids are naturally converted by the action of a sufficient degree of heat. This is the original 13th century meaning of vapor. The German equivalent of vapor is Dampf (which is relatively clearer in terms of feeling- imagine entering a basement which is damp from water vapor). Gas is relatively a new word as per the unabridged Oxford English Dictionary, and it entered English in the 1600s.
In fact, the OED mentions the distinction ""Gas: A substance in a state in which it expands freely to fill the whole of a container, having no fixed shape (unlike a solid) and no fixed volume (unlike a liquid); spec. (distinguished from a vapour) such a substance above a critical temperature such that it cannot be liquefied by the application of pressure alone""
You can also think of the general meanings of vapor in scientific usage:
A substance which is a liquid at room temperature or under ambient conditions, and if it is heated enough so that the liquid evaporates (same root of word), you can call that as vapor of that substance.
Examples: Mercury is a liquid metal, when it is heated enough in a an electric bulb, it becomes a gas, hence the name mercury vapor lamp. It is not called a mercury gas lamp.
It is not necessary that heat be involved. You will find the usage ""cold vapor method for Hg analysis"" again for mercury which means that Hg was a liquid in a sample but by blowing a gas over it, it has been evaporated.
The recent meaning of vapor from OED, ""Vapor: In modern scientific use, a fluid that fills a space like a gas but, being below its critical temperature, can be liquefied by pressure alone.""
This is clear enough. Now apply this distinction to your phase diagram and notice the position of the critical point. The vapor ""state"" is below the critical point."

How many Ga atoms are connected to one As atom in solid gallium arsenide?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/9317/how-many-ga-atoms-are-connected-to-one-as-atom-in-solid-gallium-arsenide,13k,"It is quite well established that stoichiometric gallium arsenide (CAS 1303-00-0) forms a zincblende analogous structure. It consists of two stacked face-centered cubic lattice systems (Ioffe Physical Technical Institute database). See also Uncle Al's Answer. In other words, the arsenic forms the lattice and the gallium fills half of the tetrahedral positions (and vice versa). Therefore every gallium has four arsenic nearest neighbours.
This does not necessarily mean that these are bonds. In this case however, the bonds are best described as covalent (having a somewhat ionic character).
The Britannica Online Encyclopedia (Academic Edition) (You might need access provided through an educational institution) states:

Besides the elemental semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, some binary crystals are covalently bonded. Gallium has three electrons in the outer shell, while arsenic lacks three. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) could be formed as an insulator by transferring three electrons from gallium to arsenic; however, this does not occur. Instead, the bonding is more covalent, and gallium arsenide is a covalent semiconductor. The outer shells of the gallium atoms contribute three electrons, and those of the arsenic atoms contribute five, providing the eight electrons needed for four covalent bonds. The centres of the bonds are not at the midpoint between the ions but are shifted slightly toward the arsenic.
Such bonding is typical of the III–V semiconductors — i.e., those consisting of one element from the third column of the periodic table and one from the fifth column. Elements from the third column (boron, aluminum, gallium, and indium) contribute three electrons, while the fifth-column elements (nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony) contribute five electrons. All III–V semiconductors are covalently bonded and typically have the zincblende structure with four neighbours per atom. Most common semiconductors favour this arrangement.

This is still a fluorishing field for researchers in the field of materials design semiconductors, semiconductor lasers, computational physics/forcefield development, and more.
The book ""Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory"" clearly gets it very wrong. I had a look into it and noticed they also argue with the Bohr model, which might not be a very good starting point at all. However, the focus of the book is clearly not solid state chemistry, and therefore it might fit the purpose."
EZ-Water - Fraud or breakthrough?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/5925/ez-water-fraud-or-breakthrough,87k,"EZ-water is not a breakthrough. It is not new, nor is it valid. This appears to be one of the many claims about the healthful benefits of drinking ""ionized water"".
The original ""article"" linked, contains a number of misleading statements.

Water molecules make up 99% of your body. This is true, but misleading. According to various sources, the human body is between 57% and 75% water by mass. Since water has a much lower molar mass than most biomolecules, 99% of the molecules in your body may well be water.
The journal listed in which the research is published is Water, which is not a high impact journal, despite its name. Water had an impact factor of 0.973 in 2012. That means that articles published in 2011 in Water were cited less than 1 time each by anyone in 2012. Compare with Cell, which had in impact factor of 31.957 in the same period - each article in Cell is cited an average of nearly 32 times.
Water has a ""fourth phase"" and no single boiling point or melting point. This is true! Any student of chemistry should be able to tell you this. Take a look at the phase diagram of water below. Water apparently has at least 18 phases (15 solid phases, plus liquid, vapor, and supercritical fluid). You can also see that the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor phase boundaries are not single points. They are curves varying in temperature and pressure. Those curves represent the conditions in which the two phases have the same vapor pressure. This is not a new discovery or a startling secret. This behavior has been known for many decades (if not centuries).



Later on the ""article"" tells us that EZ-water is not $\ce{H2O}$ (note that they cannot be bothered to format their chemical formulas) but $\ce{H3O2}$, which is alkaline with a negative charge. Hmmm... If it has a different formula and different properties, it must be a different compound. Note that this ""formula"" is essentially $\ce{H3O2 = H2O + OH}$, and hints at what happens inside these water ionizers.
EZ-water has a negative charge. It is possible for objects to build up charge, but it is not possible for them to remain permanently charged. Overall, the universe is balanced in charge. Consider lightning as a consequence of attempting to maintain separation of charge. This ""negative charge"" comes from a misunderstanding of pH. The water definitely has a higher pH, which means more $\ce{OH-}$ ions than $\ce{H+}$ ions, but something (probably $\ce{Na+}$) needs to replace the missing $\ce{H+}$.
I can go on, but you get the point.

A water ionizer electrolyzes water, which requires electricity (not light as suggested by Mercola). I had the good fortune to be involved in the testing and dismantling of one of these ionizers recently. The device claimed to take ordinary tap water and convert it to a ""super-cleaning solution that contained only negatively charged oxygen particles"" or something like that. From experiments:

The ionizer increases the pH of the water.
The ionizer does not work with deionized or distilled water!
The ionizer does not produce measurable oxygen gas (a smoldering splint will not relight in the vicinity)
The device contains an electrolysis cell and an ion exchange resin

Here is what happens:

Water is electrolyzed.
Doing so requires ions in the water already to conduct the electricity, which is why the device must use tap water (and not purified water). At the cathode, water is reduced to hydrogen and hydroxide. At the anode, it is oxidized to oxygen and protons.
\begin{align}
\ce{2H2O +2e- &-> H2 + 2OH-}\\
\ce{2H2O &-> O2 +4H+ + 4e-}
\end{align}

Protons are exchanged for sodium ions
To prevent the recombination of hydroxide and protons to form water and neutralize the solution, there is an ion exchange membrane between the anode and the rest of the solution.
$$\ce{H+ + OH- -> H2O}$$
The ion exchange resin collects the protons and releases sodium ions into solution to maintain charge neutrality, which must happen or you would have a lightning gun and not a mystic device to produce super water.


Ultimately, drinking this stuff would probably have no effect on your health. But we are no doctors, so don’t listen to us either. It might help or it might hurt, depending on your condition, it also might not matter.
First, your stomach secretes acid, so any extra base would be neutralized immediately. Let's say an ionizer gets the water's pH to 8 (slightly basic, and more basic than your blood). This means that the concentration of protons is $\ce{[H+]}=10^{-\text{M}pH}=10^{-8} \text{ M}$ (remember that pH is a logarithmic scale. The concentration of hydroxide is $10^{-14} / 10^{-8} = 10^{-6} \text{ M}$. The pH in your stomach ranges from 1.5 - 3.5, which represent proton concentrations between $10^{-3.5}= 3.16\times 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-1.5}=3.16\times 10^{-2}$. If we use the higher pH stomach acid to neutralize an equal volume of EZ-water, the final pH would be:
\begin{align}
[\ce{H+}]_f &= \frac{3.16\times 10^{-4} - 1\times 10^{-6}}{2}=\frac{3.15\times 10^{-4}}{2}=1.07_5 \times 10^{-4}\\
\text{pH} &=-\log[\ce{H+}] =-\log(1.07_5 \times 10^{-4})=3.97
\end{align}
Since your stomach acid would likely have a greater volume than the ionized water, the change in pH would be even smaller. This calculation assumes your stomach acid is not a buffer, which it is.
Second, the acid-base homeostasis of your blood prevents the pH of your body from changing. Yes, your blood pH is 7.4 or so (which is slightly basic), but that does not mean your blood is negatively charged. Outside of range of 7.38 - 7.42 all of your blood proteins (like hemoglobin) start to denature, which will kill you.
Well, to be more precise, you will suffocate before that happens as hemoglobin/myoglobin oxygen binding capacity is pH sensitive. And if anything, we can tolerate acidic blood more robustly than basic blood pH (down to 6.8 or 7, but only up to about 7.6) before death. You might want to look up acidosis."
Why is ammonium a weak acid if ammonia is a weak base?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/65297/why-is-ammonium-a-weak-acid-if-ammonia-is-a-weak-base,10k,"First, let’s get the definition of weak and strong acids or bases out of the way. The way I learnt it (and the way everybody seems to be using it) is:

$\displaystyle \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} < 0$ for a strong acid
$\displaystyle \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b} < 0$ for a strong base
$\displaystyle \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} > 0$ for a weak acid
$\displaystyle \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b} > 0$ for a weak base

Thus strong acid and weak base are not arbitrary labels but clear definitions based on an arbitrary measurable physical value — which becomes a lot less arbitrary if you remember that this conincides with acids stronger than $\ce{H3O+}$ or acids weaker than $\ce{H3O+}$.

Your point of confusion seems to be a statement that is commonly taught and unquestionably physically correct, which, however, students have a knack of misusing:

The conjugate base of a strong acid is a weak base.

Maybe we should write that in a more mathematical way:

If an acid is strong, its conjugate base is a weak base.

Or in mathematical symbolism:

$$\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} (\ce{HA}) < 0 \Longrightarrow \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b} (\ce{A-}) > 0\tag{1}$$

Note that I used a one-sided arrow. These two expressions are not equivalent. One is the consequence of another. This is in line with another statement that we can write pseudomathematically:

If it is raining heavily the street will be wet.
$$n(\text{raindrops}) \gg 0 \Longrightarrow \text{state}(\text{street}) = \text{wet}\tag{2}$$

I think we immediately all agree that this is true. And we should also all agree that the reverse is not necessarily true: if I empty a bucket of water on the street, then te street will be wet but it is not raining. Thus:

$$\text{state}(\text{street}) = \text{wet} \rlap{\hspace{0.7em}/}\Longrightarrow n(\text{raindrops}) \gg 0\tag{2'}$$

This should serve to show that sometimes, consequences are only true in one direction. Spoiler: this is also the case for the strength of conjugate acids and bases.
Why is the clause above on strength and weakness only true in one direction? Well, remember the way how $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}$ values are defined:
$$\begin{align}\ce{HA + H2O &<=> H3O+ + A-} && K_\mathrm{a} (\ce{HA}) = \frac{[\ce{A-}][\ce{H3O+}]}{[\ce{HA}]}\tag{3}\\[0.6em]
\ce{A- + H2O &<=> HA + OH-} && K_\mathrm{b} (\ce{A-}) = \frac{[\ce{HA}][\ce{OH-}]}{[\ce{A-}]}\tag{4}\end{align}$$
Mathematically and physically, we can add equations $(3)$ and $(4)$ together giving us $(5)$:
$$\begin{align}\ce{HA + H2O + A- + H2O &<=> A- + H3O+ + HA + OH-}&& K = K_\mathrm{a}\times K_\mathrm{b}\tag{5.1}\\[0.6em]
\ce{2 H2O &<=> H3O+ + OH-}&&K = K_\mathrm{w}\tag{5.2}\end{align}$$
We see that everything connected to the acid $\ce{HA}$ cancels out in equation $(5)$ (see $(\text{5.2})$) and thus that the equilibrium constant of that reaction is the autodissociation constant of water $K_\mathrm{w}$. From that, equations $(6)$ and $(7)$ show us how to arrive at a well-known and important formula:
$$\begin{align}K_\mathrm{w} &= K_\mathrm{a} \times K_\mathrm{b}\tag{6}\\[0.6em]
10^{-14} &= K_\mathrm{a} \times K_\mathrm{b}\\[0.6em]
14 &= \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} (\ce{HA}) + \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b} (\ce{A-})\tag{7}\end{align}$$
Now let us assume the acid in question is strong, e.g. $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} (\ce{HA}) = -1$. Then, by definition the conjugate base must be (very) weak: $$\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b}(\ce{A-}) = 14- \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}(\ce{HA}) = 14-(-1) = 15\tag{8}$$
Hence, our forward direction of statement $(1)$ holds true. However, the same is not true if we add an arbitrary weak acid to the equation; say $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} (\ce{HB}) = 5$. Then we get:
$$\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b} (\ce{B-}) = 14-\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}(\ce{HB}) = 14-5 = 9\tag{9}$$
A base with a $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b} = 9$ is a weak base. Thus, the conjugate base of the weak acid $\ce{HB}$ is a weak base.
We realise that we can generate a weak base in two ways: by plugging a strong acid into equation $(7)$ or by plugging a certain weak base. Since the sum of $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} + \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b}$ must equal $14$, it is easy to see that both cannot be strong. However, it is very possible that both the base and the acid are weak.
Thus, the reverse statement of $(1)$ is not true.
$$\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a}(\ce{HA}) < 0 \rlap{\hspace{1em}/}\Longleftarrow \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{b} (\ce{A-}) > 0\tag{1'}$$"
Why is the van der Waals coefficient b equal to four times the volume of the particle?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/37470/why-is-the-van-der-waals-coefficient-b-equal-to-four-times-the-volume-of-the-par,21k,"While most everything the previous answer states is correct, I would point out that taking four times the volume of a single particle has nothing to do with experiment and arises mathematically.
In deriving the VDW equation, the particles are still assumed to be hard spheres, but this assumption is corrected for with the parameter $a$.
The hard sphere approximation forbids that two particles penetrate each other's radii. Thus, we find that two spheres in closest contact are surrounded by a sphere of radius $2r$ (or the diameter of one of the original spheres).

(source: nyu.edu)
Thus, the volume excluded by the particles from the larger sphere surrounding the two spheres shown is
$$b' = \frac{4}{3} \pi d^3 = 8 \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$$
Thus, the excluded volume per particle $b$ is $b'/2$ or,
$$b=4 \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$
which, as you point out, is four times the volume of a single particle.
The interesting thing about this is that it does not represent the actual value of $b$ for any given atom, but represents the upper bound of $b$ for any given atom. What I mean by that is, $b$ could very well be correct by calculating four times the volume, but often experiment will show that it less than the calculated value of $b$ because atoms are not hard spheres.
For instance, using helium, which is the closest we'll get to a hard sphere:
$$b_{\ce{He},\mathrm{calc}} = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi (140\ \mathrm{pm})^3 \cdot N_\mathrm{A} = 0.02767\ \mathrm{L\ mol^{-1}}$$
while,
$$b_{\ce{He},\mathrm{exp}} = 0.0238\ \mathrm{L\ mol^{-1}}$$
So, the experimental value of $b$ is indeed smaller, but the calculated value gives a rough idea."
Turn lead into gold via radioactive decay,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15541/turn-lead-into-gold-via-radioactive-decay,13k,"Interesting idea, but it has already been done, and not cheaply - read on.

How could we get a great quantity of $\ce{_{82}^{197}Pb}$ ?

There would be two problems with getting a large amount of $\ce{_{82}^{197}Pb}$.  First, the parent nuclide of $\ce{_{82}^{197}Pb}$ is $\ce{_{83}^{197}Bi}$ which is unstable and has a half-life of only 9.33 minutes - so you can't get a large quantity of $\ce{_{82}^{197}Pb}$'s precursor to begin with.  Second, once $\ce{_{82}^{197}Pb}$ is formed, it has a half-life of 8.1 minutes, so it transmutes quickly to $\ce{_{81}^{197}Tl}$.

How long would it take for it to turn into gold?

$\ce{_{82}^{197}Pb}$ half-life = 8.1 minutes
$\ce{_{81}^{197}Tl}$ half-life = 2.84 hours
$\ce{_{80}^{197}Hg}$ half-life = 64.14 hours
After 10 half-lives, ca. 0.1% of the starting material will be left
$$\ce{(1/2)^10 = $0.0009766$}$$
The last step is the slowest by far, so after about 641.4 hours (26.73 days), you should have something around 99.9% pure gold.

Can that be accelerated?

Unlike chemical reactions that can heated, catalyzed, etc., this type of nuclear transformation keeps a set schedule. 

Once most of it has been turned into gold, how can we extract the gold
  ? (there are still remaining Pb,Tl,Hg  molecules)

As noted above, you can get whatever purity you desire, just wait.

What would be the yield of the process?

It would be high for the 3 nuclear transformations you listed.  Each of the elements you listed decays directly and only to the daughter isotope you've shown.  However, as noted above, you can't start with $\ce{_{82}^{197}Pb}$, you generate it from $\ce{_{83}^{197}Bi}$, the decay of which adds some impurity along with lead. And then since the bismuth isotope is not long-lived you'd probably start with its precursor, and so on until you find something that has a long enough life that you could assemble a reasonable quantity.
Back around 1980 Glenn Seaborg actually transmuted bismuth to gold, but only a few thousand atoms (see this reference also).

How much money would it approximately cost compared to how much we win
  in gold?

The Wikipedia article I referenced directly above notes, ""the expense far exceeds any gain.""  There are other ways (fission and fusion) to produce gold, but at least with the methods available today, the cost would be astronomical."
Overall effective activation energy for parallel reactions,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/73084/overall-effective-activation-energy-for-parallel-reactions,16k,"The activation energy $E_\mathrm a$ should, in general, be viewed as an empirical quantity that characterises the sensitivity of the rate to temperature. From this perspective, it may be obtained via the equation
$$E_\mathrm a = RT^2 \left(\frac{\mathrm d \ln k}{\mathrm dT}\right) \tag{1}$$
This relation can be ""derived"" from the Arrhenius equation. (Quotation marks because the Arrhenius equation itself is only an empirical relation.)
$$\begin{align}
k &= A\exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm a}{RT}\right) \\
\ln k &= \ln A - \frac{E_\mathrm a}{RT} \\
\frac{\mathrm d \ln k}{\mathrm dT} &= \frac{E_\mathrm a}{RT^2}
\end{align}$$
If a reaction rate has Arrhenius-type behaviour, i.e. $k = A\exp(-E_\mathrm a/RT)$, then equation $(1)$ simply returns the usual interpretation of the activation energy. However, equation $(1)$ is useful in that it allows us to define an ""activation energy"" in the case where the rate constant does not have the mathematical form $A\exp(-E/RT)$. The parallel reactions that you have described fall exactly into this category. The sum of two exponential functions generally does not return an exponential function, so the overall rate constant $k = k_1 + k_2$ should not be expected to conform to an Arrhenius description.
If we substitute
$$k = k_1 + k_2 = A_1\exp\left(-\frac{E_1}{RT}\right) + A_2\exp\left(-\frac{E_2}{RT}\right)$$
into equation $(1)$, then we get:
$$\begin{align}
E_\mathrm a &= RT^2 \cdot \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dT}\left\{ \ln\left[A_1\exp\left(-\frac{E_1}{RT}\right) + A_2\exp\left(-\frac{E_2}{RT}\right)\right] \right\} \\[8pt]
&= RT^2 \cdot \frac{A_1(E_1/RT^2)\exp(-E_1/RT) + A_2(E_2/RT^2)\exp(-E_2/RT)}{A_1\exp(-E_1/RT) + A_2\exp(-E_2/RT)} \\[8pt]
&= \frac{A_1E_1\exp(-E_1/RT) + A_2E_2\exp(-E_2/RT)}{A_1\exp(-E_1/RT) + A_2\exp(-E_2/RT)} \\[8pt]
&= \frac{E_1k_1 + E_2k_2}{k_1 + k_2}

Why copper(I) is unstable in aqueous medium?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/42855/why-copperi-is-unstable-in-aqueous-medium,15k,"You are quite correct in that it appears at first sight that $\ce{Cu+}$ should be more stable than $\ce{Cu^2+}$, but in aqueous media it isn’t. 
Stability in aqueous conditions depends on the hydration energy of the ions when they bond to the water molecules (an exothermic process). The $\ce{Cu^2+}$ ion has a greater charge density than the $\ce{Cu+}$ ion and so forms much stronger bonds releasing more energy. 
The extra energy needed for the second ionisation of the copper is more than compensated for by the hydration, so much so that the $\ce{Cu+}$ ion loses an electron to become $\ce{Cu^2+}$ which can then release this hydration energy.  A nearby $\ce{Cu+}$ ion is the most facile reduction target for the removed electron, which is why $\ce{Cu(s)}$ is also formed.
Hence, $\ce{Cu^2+}$ is more stable than $\ce{Cu+}$ in aqueous medium."
Why is formic acid a stronger acid than acetic acid?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/15662/why-is-formic-acid-a-stronger-acid-than-acetic-acid,61k,"We are discussing the following equilibrium

We can make the acid a stronger acid by pushing the equilibrium to the right.  To push the equilibrium to the right we can 

destabilize the starting acid pictured on the left side of the
equation, and \ or
stabilize the carboxylate anion pictured on the right side of the
equation.

Comparing acetic acid ($\ce{R~ =~ CH3}$) to formic acid ($\ce{R~ =~ H}$), the methyl group is electron releasing compared to hydrogen.  Therefore the methyl group will stabilize the dipolar resonance form of the starting acid where there is a partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon.  This should stabilize the starting acid. Further, this electron releasing ability of the methyl group will tend to destabilize the resultant carboxylate anion which already has a full unit of negative charge.  
Therefore, because the methyl group 1) stabilizes the starting acid and 2) destabilizes the carboxylate anion product, the methyl group will push the equilibrium to the left, compared to the case where the methyl group is replaced by a hydrogen.  Consequently, acetic acid is a weaker acid than formic acid."

When I read your question I was curious; I had never heard of this before.  I searched the internet and was only able to find one or two examples of people actually trying this successfully, and both of them looked dubious.  I've spilled superglue on cotton shirts and pants any number of times and while it cures almost instantly, it has never caught my shirt on fire.  
I decided to try it myself, and I soaked a cotton ball in superglue to see what would happen.  The glue cured extremely rapidly, producing very irritating (colorless) fumes, and the mass of glue and cotton got warm, but it was nowhere near hot enough to ignite - my tap runs hotter than the glue got.  There may be a particular type of glue that cures significantly more exothermically, but I'm inclined to think that this is an internet hoax, and Popular Science agrees."
"Relative acidities of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/32341/relative-acidities-of-alkanes-alkenes-and-alkynes,19k,"You're right in that bond length, and therefore bond strength does affect acidity (see: $\ce{H2S}$, $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} = 7$ and $\ce{H2O}$, $\mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} = 15.7$). If we defined acidity with the following equation
$$\ce{HX -> H + X}$$
then the bond strength would indeed be the only deciding factor in the acidity of $\ce{HX}$, since the enthalpy change of that process is literally the bond dissociation energy.
However, acidity actually corresponds to the heterolytic dissociation of the $\ce{H-X}$ bond, with both electrons in the bond going to $\ce{X}$:
$$\ce{HX -> H+ + X-}$$
so bond strength isn't the only factor. In the case of ethane, ethene, and ethyne, the most important factor is the type of orbital that the electrons from the $\ce{C-H}$ bond end up in after deprotonation. For ethane, the two electrons end up in a carbon $\mathrm{sp^3}$ orbital; for ethene, an $\mathrm{sp^2}$ orbital; and for ethyne, an $\mathrm{sp}$ orbital.

Now, of these three, the $\mathrm{sp}$ lone pair is the most stable, since the $\mathrm{sp}$ hybrid orbital contains the most s character ($50\%$) and therefore has the lowest energy. So, of the three carbanions, the lone pair in the acetylide ion $\ce{HC2-}$ is most stabilised, making ethyne the most acidic molecule.
The acidity of terminal alkynes is in fact pretty useful from a synthetic viewpoint, since you can deprotonate them with a strong base like $\ce{NaNH2}$, forming a carbon-based nucleophile which can then be used to make new $\ce{C-C}$ bonds.

As for why the electronic stabilisation outweighs the bond strength, it's worth looking at some quantitative data. The $\ce{H-O}$ and $\ce{H-S}$ bonds have mean bond enthalpies of $463$ and $338~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}$ respectively (source: Physical Chemistry 9th ed., Atkins & de Paula, p 932), which is a difference of $\mathbf{125~kJ~mol^{-1}}$. This can, to some extent, explain the difference in acidities of $\ce{H2O}$ and $\ce{H2S}$.
On the other hand, the dissociation energies of the $\ce{H-C\mathrm{(sp)}}$ and $\ce{H-C\mathrm{(sp^2)}}$ bonds are given in J. Phys. Chem. 1987, 91, 17-19 as $132.6$ and $116~\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ respectively. The difference is roughly $17~\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$, which is equivalent to $\mathbf{69.5~kJ~mol^{-1}}$ - a somewhat smaller value than before. You can see why bond length variations might therefore play a smaller role in the hydrocarbons.

An alternative
Another equivalent way of looking at it is that an $\mathrm{sp}$-hybridised carbon is more electronegative than an $\mathrm{sp^2}$-hybridised carbon, which is in turn more electronegative than an $\mathrm{sp^3}$-hybridised carbon.
As mentioned earlier, an $\mathrm{sp}$ orbital has the greatest s-character, and consequently electrons in a carbon $\mathrm{sp}$ orbital experience a greater effective nuclear charge and are more tightly bound to the nucleus than electrons in $\mathrm{sp^2}$ or $\mathrm{sp^3}$ orbitals.
Of course, the $\ce{C-H}$ bond also involves a contribution from the hydrogen 1s orbital. However, the above means that the electrons in $\ce{C(sp)-H}$ bonds are more strongly attracted to the carbon nucleus than electrons in $\ce{C(sp^2)-H}$ or $\ce{C(sp^3)-H}$ bonds. This means that the $\ce{C(sp)-H}$ bond is more polarised towards carbon, leaving less electron density on hydrogen, and a greater acidity.
The amount of electron density on the hydrogen can in fact be probed using $\ce{^1H}$ NMR spectroscopy. A lower electron density translates into a higher chemical shift. Even though there is a second, unrelated, factor - anisotropic shielding - that serves to decrease the chemical shift of acetylenic hydrogens, they still tend to show up at higher chemical shifts than hydrogens on saturated hydrocarbons (~2 ppm, compared to ~1 ppm). This is a clear indication that the local electron density on a proton attached to $\ce{C(sp)}$ is less than that of a proton attached to $\ce{(sp^3)}$."
"Why is cis-1,2-dichloroethene more stable than trans-1,2-dichloroethene?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95732/why-is-cis-1-2-dichloroethene-more-stable-than-trans-1-2-dichloroethene,11k,"Here's a pre-MOT rationalisation of the cis form being more stable than the trans form for 1,2-dihaloethylenes:
The lone pair of chlorine atoms is involved in resonance with the double bond, as it does so positive charge appears on one chlorine and negative on another. A cis geometry allows for a stabilizing interaction (attraction) between these positive and negative charges, which makes this resonance form a greater contributor to the resonance hybrid than it is for the trans isomer.

MOT-based explanation: 
Eyring's work suggests that there is maximum delocalisation possible in trans form.
Quoting, from the same paper: 

In a recent paper Binghams proposes that the main effect responsible for the “cis effect” of ethylenes is an effect which tends to destabilize the trans form rather than provide extra stabilization for the cis form. In short, this is an unfavorable conjugation effect which stems from the fact that the conjugation in these cases is between two filled orbitals (halogen lone pair and $\pi$ bond). The interaction gives rise to two new orbitals, one bonding and one antibonding, the latter being more antibonding than the former is bonding. Consequently, the total interaction is energetically unfavorable, in contrast to interaction in hydrocarbon polyenes. This would be equally true for both the cis and trans forms but, following Eyring’s argument, the delocalization is greater in the trans form.
  Consequently this form will be the less stable one.

I'd classify the disodium salt of EDTA as a complex. It has a metal and an organic ligand, and there's no direct metal-carbon bond (which would make it organometallic). As discussed in another question, it's a pretty arbitrary distinction between an ionic bond and a covalent one:

What are the differences between the HMQC and HSQC experiments?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/526/what-are-the-differences-between-the-hmqc-and-hsqc-experiments,30k,"You get a better resolution in the indirect dimension with an HSQC compared to an HMQC. The HSQC signal is a singlet while the HMQC is usually a multiplet as you see certain couplings on it. So generally you should prefer the HSQC over the HMQC.
One advantage of the HMQC is that it uses significantly fewer pulses than the HSQC. This means that errors in the pulses don't accumulate as much as in the HSQC, you'll lose less signal if your pulses are wrong than in the HSQC.
If you had trouble setting up an HSQC, that could mean that the probe wasn't tuned and matched properly for your sample, or that your pulse lengths were wrong. The proton pulse should be determined on each sample individually; the $\ce{^13C}$ and $\ce{^15N}$ pulses should be set up correctly already. If you're not using a probe with automatic tuning and matching you should also do that manually before the measurement.
There are a lot more HSQC and HMQC variants that are used, e.g. Sofast-HMQC or TROSY sequences that are used for larger molecules like proteins. Another interesting variant you should consider is the multiplicity-edited HSQC, where $\ce{CH2}$ signals will have the opposite sign from $\ce{CH}$ or $\ce{CH3}$ signals."
What causes the lowering of vapour pressure in volatile/nonvolatile solvent mixtures?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/22395/what-causes-the-lowering-of-vapour-pressure-in-volatile-nonvolatile-solvent-mixt,13k,"I think that the second explanation is the correct one. A simple experiment can prove it: if you place a porous cover over the pure solvent, its vapour pressure will not change. In alternative, you can place a few corks and observe the same result (no variation in the vapour pressure). In both cases surface sites are blocked, but the vapor pressure will obviously remain unaltered. Therefore the reason cannot be that the solute molecules are hindering the solvent molecule escape by occupying the solution surface. 
The force that is driving the solvent molecules to the vapour phase is the difference between the entropy of the liquid and the vapour phases: when the molecule escape the liquid there is an entropy gain. Adding a non-volatile solute will increase the entropy of the liquid phase without having an effect on the entropy of the vapour phrase (given that the solute is non-volatile). This will lower the difference in entropy between the two phases, which is the driving force that make vaporisation happen, therefore there will be a lower number of solvent particles in the vapour phase and a consequent lower vapour pressure.
Textbooks like Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change (Silberberg, Amateis) or Physical Chemistry for the Biosciences (Chang) provides the same explanation. In addition, there is a short paper/article on this topic[1] where the author highlights how only very few freshman chemistry texts give an adequate explanation of this phenomenon by making use of a entropy-based argument.

Why is it that the least reactive metals are the best electrical conductors?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/34212/why-is-it-that-the-least-reactive-metals-are-the-best-electrical-conductors,15k,"One of the reasons why non reactive metals are good conductors is that they are good at staying as metals. Most metals react with the atmosphere to form oxides. And the majority of oxides are insulators or semiconductors. Of course there are few exceptions to this rule.

Reduction of glucose to hexane with hydroiodic acid,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/46573/reduction-of-glucose-to-hexane-with-hydroiodic-acid,17k,"Hydroiodic acid is a reducing agent.  As Wikipedia says:

Although harsh by modern standards, HI was commonly employed as a reducing agent early on in the history of organic chemistry. Chemists in the 19th century attempted to prepare cyclohexane by HI reduction of benzene at high temperatures, but instead isolated the rearranged product, methylcyclopentane (see the article on cyclohexane). As first reported by Kiliani,[10] hydroiodic acid reduction of sugars and other polyols results in the reductive cleavage of several or even all hydroxy groups, although often with poor yield and/or reproducibility.[11] In the case of benzyl alcohols and alcohols with α-carbonyl groups, reduction by HI can provide synthetically useful yields of the corresponding hydrocarbon product (ROH + 2HI → RH + H
  2O + I2).[8] This process can be made catalytic in HI using red phosphorus to reduce the formed I2.[12]

When $\ce{HI}$ acts as a reducing agent, the oxidized product is $\ce{I2}$.  To regenerate $\ce{HI}$ from the $\ce{I2}$, phosphorus can be used.  Thus, phosphorus is not strictly required for the reaction, as long as you are OK with using $\ce{HI}$ in superstoichiometric amounts and/or getting very low yields.
The overall scheme for $\ce{HI}$ reduction of an alcohol to an alkane is first displacement of the (protonated) alcohol by iodide, leading to formation of alkyl iodide.  Then, $\ce{HI}$ catalyzes the reduction of the alkyl iodide to the alkane, leading to $\ce{I2}$ as a byproduct.  The reduction step apparently follows a radical mechanism, at least under some conditions.
I'm not 100% sure how $n$-hexane would form from glucose.  It is unclear to me how $\ce{HI}$ would catalyze the reduction of the glucose aldehydic (or anomeric) carbon to an alcohol.  But, that is only one carbon out of six.  The other carbons have bona fide hydroxyl groups, and as such can be deoxygenated and reduced by $\ce{HI}$ to form alkyl carbons.  For example, Lv et al. report that hydrocarbons can be obtained from the five-carbon sugar alcohol xylitol in yields above 60%.  Unlike glucose, xylitol has no aldehydic/anomeric carbon, and only has alcohol groups.  This process did use phosphorous acid as an in situ iodine recycling agent.  Also, Yang et al. were able to obtain 5-methylfurfural from fructose by using $\ce{HI}$, without using an in situ agent to recycle $\ce{}$ to $\ce{HI}$."
Is lead radioactive? [closed],https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/29196/is-lead-radioactive,19k,"Locked. There are disputes about this answer’s content being resolved at this time.

Important naturally-occurring radioactive lead nuclides are:
$\ce{^{214}Pb}$ $\left(t_{1/2}=26.8\ \mathrm{min}\right)$ from $\ce{^{238}U}$
$\ce{^{210}Pb}$ $\left(t_{1/2}=22.3\ \mathrm{a}\right)$ from $\ce{^{238}U}$
$\ce{^{211}Pb}$ $\left(t_{1/2}=36.1\ \mathrm{min}\right)$ from $\ce{^{235}U}$
$\ce{^{212}Pb}$ $\left(t_{1/2}=10.64\ \mathrm{h}\right)$ from $\ce{^{232}Th}$
(Note that 'a' here is the unit symbol for 'year'.) On a geological time scale, their half-lives are very short. Nevertheless, these lead nuclides are members of the $\ce{^{238}U}$, $\ce{^{235}U}$, and $\ce{^{232}Th}$ decay series. Thus, they are constantly reproduced by decay of their respective mother nuclides. Therefore, all environmental samples (including soil, water, air, plants, and animals) naturally contain significant amounts of radioactive lead nuclides. However, in various materials (e.g. residues from mining or oil and gas production, fertilizers, building materials), the concentration of natural lead nuclides can be strongly enhanced by technology.
When lead is freshly refined (chemically purified), most of the mother nuclides are removed and the short-lived lead nuclides quickly decay. Nevertheless, the lead still contains significant amounts of $\ce{^{210}Pb}$ $\left(t_{1/2}=22.3\ \mathrm{a}\right)$. The presence of $\ce{^{210}Pb}$ is a source of background mainly through the lead X-rays and bremsstrahlung caused by high-energy beta radiation emitted by its decay product $\ce{^{210}Bi}$. This background is a real problem when lead is used as a shielding material for low-background detectors. Therefore, some shields are made from selected lead with certified low $\ce{^{210}Pb}$ content. Preferably, very old lead is used. Since $\ce{^{210}Pb}$ decays with a half-life of 22.3 years, samples of lead that are many decades old are relatively free of this activity. In one extreme example, 2000-year-old lead was salvaged from a sunken Roman ship."
"Do chemists refer to water as ""dihydrogen monoxide""?",https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/8537/do-chemists-refer-to-water-as-dihydrogen-monoxide,33k,"No, it's not. The ""dihydrogen monoxide"" name is used as part of a hoax. In the scientific community, there are chemical names for water, and which one is used in the literature generally depends on how it interacts with something else (hydroxic acid and hydrogen hydroxide were two I heard most often in acid-base reactions).
IUPAC, the standards committee that sets standard names for chemical structures, suggests ""oxidane"" as a starting point for the construction of other names for chemicals that are derived from water. However, they do not suggest ""oxidane"" itself be used to refer to plain water.
Most chemists would use ""water"", even when writing scientific papers."
Why do all radioactive decay series terminate at lead?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/42922/why-do-all-radioactive-decay-series-terminate-at-lead,20k,"There are four main decay chains for actinides and superheavy elements. This is a simple consequence of the fact that one of the main processes to increase a heavy nucleus' stability is the emission of alpha particles, which have a mass number of 4 ($\ce{^4_2\alpha}$); notice that if you take the isotope's mass number and divide it by 4, the remainder of this division (0, 1, 2 or 3, corresponding to the $4n$, $4n+1$, $4n+2$ and $4n+3$ mass number decay chains respectively) stays constant under alpha, beta or gamma decay. There are decays which change the remainder (neutron emission, proton emission, spontaneous fission, etc) and therefore allow hopping between the main decay chains, but for simplicity these can be approximately ignored for the isotopes which are not too unstable or too heavy. 
Only three out of these four main decay chains ""stop"" at lead, so already the statement in the question is incorrect. The $4n$, $4n+2$ and $4n+3$ chains ""stop"" at $\ce{^208_82Pb}$, $\ce{^206_82Pb}$ and $\ce{^207_82Pb}$, respectively. The $4n+1$ decay chain reaches $\ce{^209_82Pb}$, but this lead isotope is quite short-lived ($t_{1/2}=3.25\ \mathrm{h})$ and decays further to $\ce{^209_83Bi}$ where it ""stops"" (or at least seemed to until 2003).
Note that I said the chains ""stopped"" at these isotopes. That's because in reality they don't. It just happens that $\ce{^208_82Pb}$, $\ce{^209_83Bi}$, $\ce{^206_82Pb}$ and $\ce{^207_82Pb}$ are all very long-lived isotopes, with half-lives billions of times greater than the current age of the Universe. This means that any continued decay is severely bottlenecked at these points, so for almost all practical purposes, the decay chains stop there. However, rigorously speaking, if you were really patient there would be further decays in the sequence. In fact, theoretically the heaviest isotope which is not susceptible to any known mode of spontaneous radioactive decay (except proton decay) is an isotope of zirconium, $\ce{^92_40Zr}$, so the decay chains actually go on well past lead or bismuth. It just takes an immense amount of time for the decays to happen."
Un-denaturing industrial alcohol,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/58550/un-denaturing-industrial-alcohol,14k,"(I'm no chemist, but here's my take on it) 
Let's see: I’m an alcoholic, and I really hate having to dole out large amounts of cash to purchase your usual ""drinking""-ethanol.
So I get this amazing idea to separate the ethanol by distillation (methanol has a lower boiling point than methanol, so what I'll really be doing is distilling out the methanol, leaving behind ethanol and water). Pretty smart, right (for someone who's still inebriated)? Thus invigorated, I sally forth... and return with a dozen gallons  of industrial (denatured) ethanol. However, as I slowly get sober, I begin to see two major obstacles to my plan:

It’s going to be very, very difficult to maintain a constant temperature of exactly 64.7 °C (boiling point of methanol). Now, even though ethanol boils at around 78 °C, trying to maintain the denatured alcohol at under (say) 70 or 75°C isn’t really an option either. Remember, what I’m trying to do here is criminal (where I'm from at least), plus I don’t really have a Nurdrage-worthy laboratory. If say, I were to simply buy a large metal vat with a distillation apparatus clamped on the top and light a fire below, at such a large scale (a dozen gallons in my case) and with the non-professional equipment I use, it’ll be impossible to ensure that the vessel is uniformly heated at a specific temperature. So what’ll happen is, I’ll end up distilling out a mixture of ethanol and methanol, and the ethanol that remains will also have significant amounts of methanol in it (10ml of methanol's enough to make you go blind… just to give you an idea about what I mean by “significant”). Regardless, I wouldn't want to engage in something that involves producing methanol vapors (be it in a proper laboratory or otherwise) 
Say I did manage to get hold of the required laboratory apparatus (I, uh, happen to know this cancer-stricken, bald, high-school Chemistry teacher who was willing to lend me them), and I were to distill the alcohol in small batches to ensure I evenly heat the solution at the desired temperature, but the whole process would be so time-consuming and labor intensive that it would probably just be better if I just went and bought ""drinking""-ethanol in the first place.
(Should have mentioned this first, but since you were talking about methanol, ah well…) To begin with, I probably wouldn't know what the manufacturers actually used to denature the alcohol. They could have used methanol, pyridine, or some other foul-tasting, foul-smelling additive for all I know, or maybe even mixed all of them together. So trying to get ethanol out of that mess, is going to be a HUGE pain in the neck.

Also you might want to read up on denatured alcohol here.

Which is the more stable enol form?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/18904/which-is-the-more-stable-enol-form,70k,"Keto-enol equilibria reflect a delicate thermodynamic balance between the two forms.

The bonding differences between the keto and enol structures shown above are:
keto: C=O double bond, C-C single bond, C-H bond
enol: C=C double bond, C-O single bond, O-H bond
If we look up the bond energies for these bonds we find
keto: 745 + 347 + 413 = 1505 kJ/mol
enol: 614 + 358 + 467 = 1439 kJ/mol
This rough calculation tells us that, generally, the keto form will predominate.  However, the energy difference between the two forms is only 66 kJ/mol, a relatively small number; so it is likely that small differences can cause a dramatic shift in the relative concentrations of the two species.
Some general guidelines for predicting shifts in keto-enol equilibria

Aromaticity and conjugation - The keto-enol equilibrium for phenol (I) lies entirely on the enol side due to thermodynamic stabilization provided by aromaticity. Compound III would be expected to have a higher enol content than compound II due to the extended conjugation present in the enol of III
Substitution - Replacing hydrogen with alkyl groups on a double bond stabilizes the double bond. Therefore, we would expect compound V to have a higher enol content than compound IV
Dipolar repulsion - The carbonyl dipoles in butane-2,3-dione (VI) can reduce their electrostatic repulsion by adopting the geometry pictured with the carbonyl groups oriented away from one another.  Due to the constraints of the 5-membered ring, cyclopentane-1,2-dione (VII) cannot adopt a similar geometry.  In this case, the dipolar repulsion is lessened by increasing the enol content in the equilibrium to a point where the enol predominates.
Hydrogen Bonding - Hydrogen bonding can stabilize the enol form.  If the hydrogen bond is strong enough, and particularly if other factors also stabilize the enol form, the enol form can predominate.  Your molecule, 2,4-pentanedione (IX), is a good example.  There are two possible enol forms, VIII and X. X is by far the predominant enol as it has 1) extended conjugation and 2) substitution on the carbon-carbon double bond.  In addition, X can form a very stable hydrogen bond involving a 6-membered structure between the two oxygen atoms.
Solvent Effects - Especially in cases where hydrogen bonding is involved in stabilizing the enol, the solvent can have a dramatic effect. In benzene, where intramolecular hydrogen bonding predominates, the IX:X ratio is approximately 5:95. In water, where the intramolecular hydrogen bond is replaced by hydrogen bonding to the solvent, the ratio is roughly reversed.
Answer to your question
Cyclopent-2-enone can form two different enols, XI and XIII. Neither enol has any features that would be expected to provide significant enol stabilization.  There is no more conjugation than what is found in the ketone, there is no special hydrogen bonding, and no substitution of the carbon-carbon double bonds.  Indeed, the proton nmr of cyclopentenone is just as expected, no evidence for a significant amount of enol.  On the other hand, 2,4-pentanedione exists primarily as the enol form, at least in non-polar solvents, for the 3 reasons (conjugation, hydrogen bond, double bond substitution) discussed above.
As an aside, you mentioned that a 5-membered ring with two double bonds (a cyclopentadiene) might not be very stable; actually, they are quite stable and quite common, 2 double bonds in a 5-membered ring do not create a lot of strain."
Why there is no change in water level when salt is added?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/33058/why-there-is-no-change-in-water-level-when-salt-is-added,60k,"This is an example of electrostriction - see, for example, this paper for a full explanation. 
In short, the solvent molecules become more ordered in the vicinity of dissolved (charged) ions and less ordered as we go further away from the dissolved (charged) ions. The increase of solvent density near the ions is offset by the decrease of bulk density in the solvent as distance from the ions increases. This results in an overall net reduction in the observed volume of the solution.
From the Discussion section of the manuscript:

The interaction of the electrostatic field of an 
  ion with water tends to align the dipolar water 
  molecules in the direction of the field. In this way 
  the field tends to disrupt hydrogen bonded 
  structures in liquid water, and to compress the 
  water molecules surrounding an ion. These 
  electrostatic effect give rise to a shrinkage of the 
  water."
Contribution of Tetrahedral and Octahedral voids in HCP,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/111914/contribution-of-tetrahedral-and-octahedral-voids-in-hcp,37k,"I cannot find anywhere..

Couldn't find? You can figure it out on your own, with me, right now.
Disclaimer: By ""hexagonal unit cell"" I assume you mean hexagonal prism, which comprises of 3 primitive hexagonal Bravais lattice. 

Octahedral Voids (OhV)
The one on the left displays octahedral voids(visibly surrounded by 6 atoms).
The OhV is at the center of the highlighted octahedron, and lies on the plane containing four of the six lattice points in the octahedron. 
Note that these lattice points belong to the unit cell, and the OhV must hence lie inside the unit cell.
This is the same for the other 5, amounting to a total of 6 OhV per HCP unit cell.
Being completely inside, its contribution is taken as 1.

BONUS: If you remember, No. of atoms per unit cell is 6, which
tallies with the no. of OhV given by the formula $N_{OhV}=N$ where
$N$ represents no. of atoms per unit cell.

Tetrahedral Voids (ThV)
I'm going to be frank: it IS not as easy as locating OhV.
The figure above absolutely freaked me out when I tried to visualize ThV's. I'm not keen on recommending that.
Instead, this 3D rendition should help immensely.
Type 1 ThV

The Type 1 Thv's are the ones inside in unit cell completely(so again, contribution=1).
Notice that I have marked 2 tetrahedrons. Also note that each tetrahedron we form will tell us about the ThV its existence creates.

RED: Note that there will be another 2 like this one in the lower half. That makes a total of 6 Red-type ThV in the entire HCP unit cell.
GREEN: Note that there will be a total of 2 of the green-type ThV, the other one belonging to the inverted tetrahedron just below it.

That gives us a total of $6+2=8$ Type 1 ThV.
Type 2
Let's do a little recap to see which ThVs have we counted so far(displayed in red)

I constructed a 3D model of 3 HCPs, which is required to visualize the remaining.

Now I will mark the ThV forming lattice points in red.


As you can see, lattice points from 3 unit cells are involved.
A quick analysis tells us that there will be 2 such Tetrahedrons for every vertical edge.
A quicker analysis tells us that since each ThV so formed is present in 3 HCP unit cells, or is ""shared"" by them, Its contribution must be $\frac 13$.
We count the number of such tetrahedrons to be 12 per unit cell; with contributions, ThV Type 2 will be $12*\frac 13$ $=4$.
Ultimately, we get:
ThV type 1= 8
ThV type 2= 4
Total ThV= 12.
Which brilliantly tallies with the formula for number of ThV($N_{ThV}=2N$).
I hope managed to enlighten you.
TL;DR

OhV contribution is 1, no issues there.
ThV does not have a single ""contribution"", but rather could be 1 or
$\frac 13$ depending on which ThV you're talking about."

Is there a difference between equilibrium and steady state?,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/110794/is-there-a-difference-between-equilibrium-and-steady-state,30k,"Yes, equilibrium and steady-state are distinct concepts.
A reaction is at equilibrium if reactants and products are both present, the forward and reverse rates are equal and the concentrations don't change over time. If this is the only reaction in a closed, isolated system, the entropy in the system is constant.
Steady-state implies a system that is not at equilibrium (entropy increases). A species is said to be at steady state when the rate of reactions (or more general, processes) that form the species is equal to the rate of reactions (or processes) that remove the species.
In both cases, there are rates ($\mathrm{rate}_1$ and $\mathrm{rate}_2$) that are equal. For an equilibrium, the forward and reverse rate of the same reaction are equal to each other. For a steady state, the rates of processes leading to increase of the concentration of a species are equal to the rates of processes leading to decrease of the concentration of the same species.
$$\ce{A <=>[rate_1][rate_2] B}\ \ \ \ \    vs \ \ \ \ \  \ce{source->[rate_1]C->[rate_2]sink}   $$
For an equilibrium, all concentrations are constant over time. For a steady-state, there is a net reaction, so some amounts change (the amount of source and sink), while at least one species - the one at steady state - has a constant concentration as long as the conditions of steady state prevail."
